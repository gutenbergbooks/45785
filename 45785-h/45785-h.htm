    <h2><a id="A_Month_of_Battles" name="A_Month_of_Battles"></a><span class=
    "smcap">A Month of Battles</span></h2>

    <p>Military activity superseded everything else during the month under
    review. Europe shook with the roar of battle. From May 27 to June 15 fully
    3,000,000 men were engaged in deadly conflict along the battlefronts of
    France, with a ghastly toll of blood, while in Italy along a front of 100
    miles more than 2,000,000 joined battle on June 15 and were furiously
    fighting when this issue went to press. The third German offensive, which
    continued for three weeks, did not break the front, nor did it divide the
    Allies, nor were the Channel ports reached, nor was Paris invested. In all
    these respects the drive failed, but important new territory was won by the
    Germans, and they claimed over 85,000 prisoners and an enormous amount of
    booty; the Allies declared that the failure of the Germans to obtain any of
    their objectives, coupled with the frightful price they had paid in killed
    and wounded, the shock to the army morale, and the disappointment in the
    enemy leadership, operated practically as a German defeat almost
    approaching disaster.</p>

    <p><a id="American_co-operation" name="American_co-operation"></a>American
    co-operation in the war became profoundly significant during the month. The
    announcement was authorized early in June that more than 800,000 Americans
    were in France and that American soldiers were occupying important sectors
    on the front. Their brilliant stand on the Marne and at Belleau Wood, where
    they were victorious over crack Prussian divisions, created great
    enthusiasm throughout this country and evoked warmest encomiums from all
    the Allies. It was announced that American forces were holding a sector on
    German soil in the Vosges. It was understood that United States troops were
    crossing the Atlantic at the rate of nearly 40,000 a week, and that with
    the steady gain in shipping facilities an American Army in France of
    1,500,000 was assured by Oct. 15, 1918. There was evidence that the Germans
    had realized the gravity of American intervention, and that their great
    offensive was based on the fear that ultimate defeat awaited them unless
    they could obtain immediate victory.</p>

    <p>The offensive launched by the Austrians in Italy on June 15 was their
    most ambitious undertaking during the war. It was reported that they had
    1,000,000 men engaged and 7,500 guns. At the end of the fourth day it was
    generally felt that the offensive had failed, as none of the objectives was
    obtained.</p>

    <p>There were no important military activities on any of the other
    fronts.</p>

    <p>German submarines invaded American waters late in May and within three
    weeks torpedoed twenty vessels, among them several steamships. There was no
    panic; the only effect was a fuller realization that the country was at
    war, with a marked speeding up of recruiting and a deepened determination
    that the war should be waged until victory was won. The raid caused no
    pause in the steady flow of troops to Europe. The submarine sinkings
    materially diminished in European waters, and the completion of new tonnage
    by the Allies during the month outstripped the losses by thousands of tons.
    It was clear during this period that the United States had attained its
    full stride in building ships, airplanes, and ordnance.</p>

    <p>The growing importance of aerial warfare was universally recognized
    during the month, and the deadly efficiency of air squadrons in battle was
    demonstrated as never before.</p>

    <p>The Russian situation became no clearer, though there was a growing
    impression that the Bolsheviki were steadily declining in power, while the
    forces of order and moderation were strengthening. The movement for
    intervention by Japan in Siberia gained momentum, but Washington gave no
    indication of giving its assent. The German progress into Russia continued,
    yet there were signs that <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_2" name=
    "Page_2">[Pg 2]</a></span> the Ukrainians were resenting German methods and
    were becoming a troublesome factor to the invaders. The Germanization of
    Finland and the other Russian border provinces proceeded apace. In the
    Caucasus the Turks continued to acquire new power over former Russian
    territory, and the spread of Turanian dominion was advanced.</p>

    <p>Austria-Hungary was in a ferment during the month, and there was every
    indication that the Poles, Czechs, and Slavs were working in harmony and
    were threatening the existence of the Dual Empire.</p>

    <p>In Great Britain, Italy, and France political matters were quieter, and
    a better feeling prevailed than for many months, while in our own country
    there was more war enthusiasm and less political discord than at any
    previous time in the nation's history.</p>

    <h2><span class="smcap">The Transportation of Troops in Great
    Wars</span></h2>

    <p>The announcement on June 15 that the United States had successfully
    carried over three-quarters of a million troops to France, a distance of
    more than 3,000 miles by sea, with the statement, made at the same time,
    that the Allies had successfully transported the enormous number of
    17,000,000 to and from the various battle zones, both with absolutely
    negligible losses, serves to bring up the interesting question of the
    movements of vast bodies of men in earlier wars. Leaving out the primitive
    wars, in which troops were moved only by land, and almost wholly on foot,
    to begin with the great Persian invasion of Europe, in the fifth century
    before our era: Xerxes transported an enormous army, fabled to number five
    millions, and certainly reaching nearly half a million combatants, across
    the water-barrier of Europe by building a pontoon bridge over the
    Hellespont, between three and four miles wide; but the Persians had also,
    at Salamis, between 1,000 and 1,200 ships, which was a sufficiently great
    achievement in transportation. On the return invasion of Asia by the
    Greeks, Alexander the Great likewise crossed the Hellespont, at the site of
    the Gallipoli fighting, by a bridge of boats; the latest crossing of a
    great army on pontoons being that of the Russians at the Danube, when they
    invaded Turkey in 1877. A feat in transportation of another kind was that
    of Hannibal, who carried his mixed army of Africans, Spaniards, and Gauls
    across the Alps, probably at Mont Genevre, in the Summer of 218; an
    achievement later repeated by Napoleon and the Russian General Suvoroff. A
    more recent feat in transportation was the bringing of British and French
    troops to America, in the days of Washington. But the closest analogy to
    the present achievement of the American Army and Navy is probably that of
    the transportation of British troops to South Africa, twenty years ago, the
    distance being over 6,000 miles, or about twice the distance of our
    Atlantic port from the landing place of our troops in France. The total
    British losses in South Africa have more than once been equaled by one
    week's British casualties in the present struggle in France, the ratio of
    killed to wounded being about the same, namely, one to five.</p>

    <h2><a id="Armies_Under_Foreign_Generals" name=
    "Armies_Under_Foreign_Generals"></a><span class="smcap">Armies Under
    Foreign Generals</span></h2>

    <p>The brigading of American troops with French and English commands and
    the fact that the entire forces of England and Italy, as well as America,
    on the Continent, are commanded by a French soldier recall that in many
    past wars large forces of one nation served under leaders of another
    nation. In the Napoleonic wars there were numberless instances of these
    armies of composite nationality, the most striking example being, probably,
    the Grand Army which invaded Russia in 1811, in which there was only a
    minority of French soldiers, nearly all Western Europe contributing the
    majority. But these foreign troops served by compulsion, not of good-will.
    A better analogy is the war of the Spanish succession, in which both the
    Duke of Marlborough and Prince Eugene commanded composite armies,
    voluntarily united; this war transferred Newfoundland and Nova Scotia from
    France to England. In the wars in India, English commanders have almost
    invariably had a majority of native troops in their<span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_3" name="Page_3">[Pg 3]</a></span> forces, and this
    was conspicuously the case in the second half of the eighteenth century, as
    in Clive's decisive victory at Plassey.</p>

    <p>Considerable numbers of French troops served under an American Commander
    in Chief at an eventful period in this country's history; of the 16,000 who
    forced the surrender of Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown, about half were French
    troops, under Lafayette and Rochambeau. A generation later, when Napoleon
    was trying to subdue Spain, mixed forces of English, Portuguese, and
    Spanish troops fought, under the Duke of Wellington and his colleagues,
    against the invaders. At Waterloo also the Duke of Wellington had an army
    of several different nationalities under his command, though the Dutch and
    Belgian troops played no great part in the later stages of the battle. In
    the war of 1877, considerable Russian and Rumanian armies fought under a
    single commander who was, for a considerable period, Prince Charles (later
    King) of Rumania.</p>

    <p><a id="The_Northern_and_Southern_Slavs" name=
    "The_Northern_and_Southern_Slavs"></a></p>

    <h2><span class="smcap">The Northern and Southern Slavs</span></h2>

    <p>The conference at Rome, April 10, 1918, to settle outstanding questions
    between the Italians and the Slavs of the Adriatic, has once more drawn
    attention to those Slavonic peoples in Europe who are under non-Slavonic
    rule. At the beginning of the war there were three great Slavonic groups in
    Europe: First, the Russians with the Little Russians, speaking languages
    not more different than the dialect of Yorkshire is from the dialect of
    Devonshire; second, a central group, including the Poles, the Czechs or
    Bohemians, the Moravians, and Slovaks, this group thus being separated
    under the four crowns of Russia, Germany, Austria, and Hungary; the third,
    the southern group, included the Sclavonians, the Croatians, the
    Dalmatians, Bosnians, Herzegovinians, the Slavs, generally called Slovenes,
    in the western portion of Austria, down to Goritzia, and also the two
    independent kingdoms of Montenegro and Serbia.</p>

    <p>Like the central group, this southern group of Slavs was divided under
    four crowns, Hungary, Austria, Montenegro, and Serbia; but, in spite of the
    fact that half belong to the Western and half to the Eastern Church, they
    are all essentially the same people, though with considerable infusion of
    non-Slavonic blood, there being a good deal of Turkish blood in Bosnia and
    Herzegovina. The languages, however, are practically identical, formed
    largely of pure Slavonic materials, and, curiously, much more closely
    connected with the eastern Slav group—Russia and Little Russia—than with
    the central group, Polish and Bohemian. A Russian of Moscow will find it
    much easier to understand a Slovene from Goritzia than a Pole from Warsaw.
    The Ruthenians, in Southern Galicia and Bukowina, are identical in race and
    speech with the Little Russians of Ukrainia.</p>

    <p>Of the central group, the Poles have generally inclined to Austria,
    which has always supported the Polish landlords of Galicia against the
    Ruthenian peasantry; while the Czechs have been not so much anti-Austrian
    as anti-German. Indeed, the Hapsburg rulers have again and again played
    these Slavs off against their German subjects. It was the Southern Slav
    question, as affecting Serbia and Austria, that gave the pretext for the
    present war. At this moment, the central Slav question—the future destiny
    of the Poles—is a bone of contention between Austria and Germany. It is the
    custom to call these Southern Slavs "Jugoslavs," from the Slav word Yugo,
    "south," but as this is a concession to German transliteration, many prefer
    to write the word "Yugoslav," which represents its pronunciation. The South
    Slav question was created by the incursions of three Asiatic peoples—Huns,
    Magyars, Turks—who broke up the originally continuous Slav territory that
    ran from the White Sea to the confines of Greece and the Adriatic.</p>

    <h2><a id="Germanys_Population_Declining" name=
    "Germanys_Population_Declining"></a><span class="smcap">Germany's
    Population Declining</span></h2>

    <p>A careful study of the vital statistics of Germany and Great Britain
    reveals the fact that the population of Germany is declining, while that of
    Great Britain is increasing. The German Empire, which in June, 1919, at the
    previous rate of increase should have had 72,000,000 people, will have no
    more than 64,500,000. Germany as a whole will have 5 per cent. less
    population than when the war began. Of those who have been killed the
    greater number were men in the prime of life and energy, whom Germany could
    least spare. By deaths in the battle zone the empire has lost at least
    3,000,000 men.</p>

    <p>The birth rate has sunk to such a figure that by next year the number of
    births will have fallen short of what they would have been had there been
    no war by 3,333,000. In the same period the annual number of deaths among
    the German civilian population, owing to the stress and anxiety of the war,
    and sickness, which has been aggravated by hardships and food troubles, has
    increased by 1,000,000 over the normal.</p>

    <p>While by next year the German Empire will be 7,500,000 lower in
    population than it would have been had the war not taken place, the
    vitality of the peoples of Austria and Hungary has suffered even more. The
    peoples of Austria will be 11 per cent. poorer in numbers next year than if
    the war had not taken place. They will be 8 per cent. lower in numbers than
    they were in 1914. Hungary will be still worse off. It will have a
    population 9 per cent. lower than before the war, and 13 per cent. lower
    than it would have been if there had been no war.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile, despite the losses suffered in the war zone, the British
    population has been growing. By the middle of 1919 this population will be
    only 3 per cent. lower than it would have been without war. Great Britain
    in 1919 will have a larger population than in 1914.</p>

    Rail</span></h2>

    <p>It was officially announced May 11 that the swing bridge over the Suez
    Canal at Kantara was completed, and that on May 15, 1918, there was direct
    railway service from Cairo to Jerusalem. When the war broke out there were
    no railways between the Suez Canal and the Jaffa-Jerusalem railway, a
    distance of some 200 miles, mainly desert.</p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 600px;">
        <a id="Cairo_to_Jerusalem_by_Rail_Map" name=

        <div class="caption"></div>
    </div>

    <p>At that time a line ran along the western bank of the canal from Suez to
    Port Said. It was linked up with the main lines of the Egyptian State
    railways by a single track from Ismailia to Zagazig. <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_5" name="Page_5">[Pg 5]</a></span>A few miles to the
    north of that track another line from Zagazig stopped some eighteen miles
    short of the canal at El Salhia. At the beginning of the war, to facilitate
    the transport of troops and supplies to the canal and beyond, the track
    from Zagazig to Ismailia was doubled, and a new line was pushed out from
    the dead end at El Salhia to the canal opposite Kantara, a village on the
    eastern, or Sinai, side of the canal. Later, when the British troops
    entered the Sinai Peninsula, a railway was begun from Kantara eastward, and
    as the British troops advanced so did the railway. It followed the northern
    track across Sinai, and had been taken within a few miles of Gaza when that
    town was captured last November. Meantime the Turks had built a branch from
    the Jaffa-Jerusalem line to a point only five miles north of Gaza, and by
    February General Allenby had joined the two systems, so that there was
    direct railway connection between Kantara and Jerusalem.</p>

    <h3><a id="Kindling_the_Holy_Fire" name=
    "Kindling_the_Holy_Fire"></a><span class="smcap">Kindling the Holy
    Fire</span></h3>

    <p>The annual ceremony of the Kindling of the Holy Fire took place May 4 in
    the Church of the Holy Sepulchre in Jerusalem. In Turkish days it was the
    custom to provide a guard of not less than 600 soldiers in order to keep
    the peace between the Greeks and Armenians, as disorders almost invariably
    occurred. On this occasion there was no guard of any kind other than the
    ordinary police, and the ceremony took place without any sign of
    disturbance.</p>

    <p>The ceremony of the Holy Fire—at which, it is held, flame comes by a
    miracle from heaven to kindle the lamps of the Holy Sepulchre—apparently
    began in the ninth century, and was formerly attended by leading
    representatives of all the churches. These have long ago withdrawn from it,
    and it is now attended by members of the Greek and Armenian Churches,
    mostly ignorant pilgrims of Eastern Christendom. Many enlightened members
    of the Greek Church discouraged the ceremony, as the vast crowds of
    frenzied people attending it had to be kept in some sort of order by
    Turkish soldiers. At the appointed time a bright flame of burning wood
    appears through a hole in the Chapel of the Holy Sepulchre; the rush to
    obtain this new fire is overwhelming, and it is handed on from taper to
    taper until thousands of lights appear. A mounted horseman takes a lighted
    torch to convey the sacred fire to the lamp of the Greek Church in the
    convent at Bethlehem. In 1834 hundreds of lives were lost in the violent
    pressure of the unruly crowd.</p>

    "Building_the_Cape_to_Cairo_Railway"></a><span class="smcap">Building the
    Cape to Cairo Railway</span></h3>

    <p>Notwithstanding the war, 200 miles of the Cape to Cairo Railway in
    Africa were laid in the last four years, and a total of 450 miles in the
    last eight years from the Rhodesian frontier to the navigable waterway of
    the Congo. The latest section of the Katanga Railway reached Bukama, on the
    Congo River, May 22.</p>

    <p>The railway starts from Cape Town and crosses Bechuanaland and Rhodesia;
    it reached the Congo frontier in 1909. The first section (158 miles)
    reached the copper mines of the Star of the Congo in November, 1910, where
    Elizabethville, a populous town, inhabited by 1,400 white men, has since
    developed. The railway was pushed in 1913 as far as Kambové, another
    important mining district, (99 miles.) In spite of the difficulties caused
    by the war, a third section was open to traffic north of Kambové, reaching
    Djilongo (68 miles) in July, 1915. It was through this road that the two
    English monitors, under the direction of Commander G. B. Spicer Simson,
    reached the waters of Lake Tanganyika, which they cleared of enemy craft.
    Understanding the advantages which the line would afford, the Belgian
    Colonial Government opened new credits for the completion of the railway as
    far as Bukama, (125 miles.) The building started from Djilongo and Bukama
    at the same time, and, in spite of the difficulties of the ground and the
    scarcity of labor in the region traversed, has now been successfully
    completed. More than 30,000 tons of copper are annually transported from
    the Congo copper mines.</p>

    <h3><a id="Compiegne_and_Its_Forest" name=
    "Compiegne_and_Its_Forest"></a><span class="smcap">Compiegne and Its
    Forest</span></h3>

    <p>Compiegne, the northern support of the French battlefront during the
    early part of June, goes back to Roman days. Its name is a modernization of
    Compendium, which seems to have meant the "short cut" between Soissons and
    Beauvais. The castle, which was founded by Charles the Bald, was rebuilt by
    Charles V. and Louis XV. It is now practically a historical museum of
    pictures, sculpture, vases, beautiful French furniture. The Hôtel de Ville,
    the Town Hall, was built under Louis XII., and is now adorned by a recent
    statue of Jeanne d'Arc, whose cult has been so widely revived in the last
    few years in France. And the old churches of Saint James and Saint Antony
    go back to the France of Charles VIII. and Louis XII. The magnificent
    forest of Compiègne, with its century-old oaks and beeches, covers some
    36,000 acres, or almost sixty square miles, and has nearly ninety miles of
    parkways under its shady boughs. Within it, near Champlieu, are old Roman
    ruins, and the huge, many-towered Château of Pierrefonds, which was a
    favorite hunting lodge of the Kings of France. Built in the fourteenth
    century, it was rebuilt by Viollet-le-Duc. It is curious that the modern
    use of airplanes in military scouting, in conjunction with our powerful
    artillery, has given these forests a significance in battle which takes us
    back not merely to the days of mediaeval warfare with its forest ambushes
    but to the earlier fighting of primitive tribes.</p>

    <h3><a id="The_Forest_of_Villers-Cotterets" name=
    "The_Forest_of_Villers-Cotterets"></a><span class="smcap">The Forest of
    Villers-Cotterets</span></h3>

    <p>The immense importance of forests in the present battle is only one
    among many returns to the machinery of mediaeval war, like the revival of
    helmets, bombs, mortars, the use of a trench knife, which is simply an
    adapted Roman broadsword. And, in exactly the same way, the pressure of
    races in the present war has brought the fighting back to the old, famous
    battle areas, on which the Latin races have fought against the barbarians
    any time these two thousand years. This is particularly true of the area of
    the fighting in the first half of June. Much of the history here goes back
    to old Roman times, much to the earliest Kings of France.
    Villers-Cotterets, in the old feudal territory of Valois, has developed
    from a sixth century hamlet, first named Villers-Saint-Georges. The great
    forest, which has been so strong a buttress for the French and American
    line, was then known as Col-de-Retz, and was a favorite hunting ground of
    the early Kings. The Château Malmaison, rebuilt by Francis I. in 1530, was
    really a magnificent hunting lodge; his son, Henry II., and Francis II.
    often sojourned there. Charles V. halted there during his campaign in
    Champagne. Charles IX. spent his honeymoon there with his young Queen
    Elizabeth. The castle was restored by the Duke of Orleans in 1750, at a
    cost of 2,000,000 francs, when the great walls of the park were built. He
    was the father of Philippe-Egalité and the grandfather of King Louis
    Philippe. Alexandre Dumas, who was born at Villers-Cotterets, described the
    castle as being "as big as the whole town." Later it became an orphanage,
    sheltering 800 children. In the forest is the "enchanted butte," 752 feet
    above sea level, which is dimly visible from Laon, forty-four miles away;
    here the fairies were traditionally believed to dance in the moonlight.
    Finally, in the last martial act of Napoleon's Hundred Days—on June 27,
    1815, a week after Waterloo—Marshal Grouchy fought the Prussians under
    Pirch within sight of Villers-Cotterets.</p>

    <h3><span class="smcap"><a id="Chateau-ThierryP6" name=
    "Chateau-ThierryP6"></a>Chateau-Thierry</span></h3>

    <p>Chateau-Thierry, which has added a splendid page to the martial history
    of the American Army, is another of the ancient strongholds whose strategic
    position has given it equal significance in the recent fighting. It was
    originally a Roman camp, Castrum Theodorici. The castle, built in 730 by
    Charles Martel, was given in 877 by Louis II., "the Stammerer," to Herbert,
    Count of Vermandois, from whose family it passed in the tenth century to
    the Counts of Troyes. At the end of the eleventh century the town, which
    had grown up under the shelter of the <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"
    name="Page_7">[Pg 7]</a></span>fortress, was surrounded by a wall, and the
    Burgesses of the town, in 1520, received permission from Francis I. to
    found a leather and cloth fair, which was long famous. Often a
    battleground, Château-Thierry was captured by the English in 1421. It was
    sacked by the Spanish in 1591. It was a centre of French resistance in the
    invasion of 1814, and Napoleon with 24,000 veterans decisively beat Blücher
    with 50,000 men under the historic walls of the ancient fortress. The
    fabulist La Fontaine was born here on July 8, 1621.</p>

    <h3><a id="Infant_Welfare_in_Germany" name=
    "Infant_Welfare_in_Germany"></a><span class="smcap">Infant Welfare in
    Germany</span></h3>

    <p>The British Local Government Board issued a report on infant welfare in
    Germany, May 17, 1918, from which the following facts are taken:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>During the war there has been a heavy fall in the number of births
        in Germany. The first three years alone of the war reduced by over
        2,000,000 the number of babies who would have been born had peace
        prevailed. Some 40 per cent. fewer babies were born in 1916 than in
        1913. The infantile death rate has been kept well down, but is 50 per
        cent. higher than in Great Britain.</p>

        <p>The birth rate, which had risen from 36.1 per 1,000 inhabitants in
        the decade 1841-1850 to 39.1 per 1,000 in the period 1871-1880, fell in
        the succeeding decades to 36.8, 36.1, and 31.9. The rate for the last
        year of the period 1901-1910 was under 30 per 1,000, and the
        continuance of the fall brought the rate as low as 28.3 in 1912.</p>

        <p>In 1913 there were 1,839,000 live births in Germany; in 1916 there
        were only 1,103,000—a decrease of 40 per cent. as compared with 1913.
        The corresponding figures for England and Wales (785,520 live births in
        1916 against 881,890 in 1913) show a decrease of 10.9 per cent.</p>

        <p>In 1913 the infant mortality rate for Germany was 151 per 1,000, as
        compared with 108 in England and Wales. The rates in 1914 for Prussia,
        Saxony, and Bavaria (comprising nearly 80 per cent. of the total
        population of Germany) were 164, 173, and 193 per 1,000 respectively.
        The abnormal increase in infant mortality during the first months of
        the war is shown by the fact that in Prussia in the third quarter of
        1914 the rate rose from 128 to 143; in Saxony from 140 to 242; and in
        Bavaria from 170 to 239.</p>

        <p>The principal measure adopted in Germany to promote infant welfare
        during the war has been the distribution of the imperial maternity
        grants. "Necessity" must first be proved, but instructions have been
        given that the term "necessity" is to be liberally interpreted. There
        was a general demand that some further provision should be made for
        soldiers' wives who could not meet the extra expenses connected with
        the birth of a child, and by a Federal Order, published on Dec. 3,
        1914, provision was made for the payment (partly from imperial funds
        and partly from the funds of the sickness insurance societies) of the
        following allowances:</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(a) A single payment of $6.25 toward the expenses of
        confinement.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(b) An allowance of 25 cents daily, including Sundays
        and holidays, for eight weeks, at least six of which must be after the
        confinement.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(c) A grant up to $2.50 for medical attendance during
        pregnancy if needed.</p>

        <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;(d) An allowance for breast-feeding at the rate of 12½
        cents a day, including Sundays and holidays, for 12 weeks after
        confinement.</p>

        <p>These grants were afterward extended to women whose husbands were
        employed on patriotic auxiliary service and women who were themselves
        employed on such service. In addition to this special measure, steps
        were taken to encourage the formation of local societies for promoting
        infant welfare and the establishment by the societies of infant welfare
        centres. Steps were taken to protect illegitimate children by assisting
        unmarried mothers from municipal funds and to give expectant and
        nursing mothers additional rations of food.</p>

    <hr class="tb" />

    <p><a id="potatoes" name="potatoes"></a>As a result of intensive farming
    propaganda, the acreage of cereals and potatoes in England and Wales in
    1917 was 8,302,000, an increase of 2,042,000 over 1916. It is estimated
    that the tillage in 1917 in Scotland increased 300,000 acres over 1916, and
    in Ireland the figures showed an increase of 1,500,000 acres, making a
    total of about 4,000,000 acres increase in the United Kingdom in the year.
    This was accomplished in the face of the fact that in England and Wales
    alone there were 200,000 fewer male laborers on the land in 1917 than
    before the war. It is estimated that the United Kingdom in 1918-19 will
    produce 80 per cent. of the total breadstuff requirements for the year,
    whereas in 1916-17 the production was but 20 per cent. of the needs.</p>

    America's aid in the war and the brilliant part taken already by American
    troops. He moved a vote of credit of $2,500,000,000, which was promptly
    given. The vote brought the total British war credits to $36,500,000,000.
    It will cover expenditures to Sept. 1, 1918. Bonar Law stated that the
    daily cost of the war to Great Britain was $34,240,000. The debt due Great

    </a>Military Review From May 18 to June 18, 1918—Fighting on the Marne and
    Oise—The Austrian Offensive</h3>

    <p>The third month of the great German offensive may be considered the
    complement of the second; it has been an attempt to accomplish south of the
    great Picardy salient what north of it had been tried and had failed. In
    the second month the Lys salient had been developed, but the barrier ridges
    of Ypres and Arras still held. At the end of the third month the southern
    barriers—the Chemin-des-Dames and the watershed of the Oise-Aisne—had been
    carried by the enemy, but the terrain of occupation was so constricted, the
    enemy troops so distributed, that neither of his ambitious objectives had
    been brought nearer attainment. These objectives were the reaching of the
    sea by the Somme via Amiens, with its corollaries, the isolation of the
    allied armies north of that river and the occupation of the Channel ports;
    the decisive defeat of the French armies in the field, with whatever moral
    and political corollary that eventuality might produce; the occupation of
    Paris, and the demoralization of the French body politic. [See map on Page
    19.]</p>

    <p>But the German failure of the third month is far more significant, has a
    far greater bearing on the war, than the failure of the second. The enemy
    has not only failed to broaden the Picardy front so as to permit a further
    advance down the Somme, to inflict vital losses on the Allies, to force the
    French back on the defenses of Paris, but, in attempting to do these things
    he has transformed all his potential resources into active resources, and
    these give evidence of approaching exhaustion.</p>

    <p>Only one conclusion is possible: Ludendorff with an initial
    preponderance of men and war material, with the tactical advantage of being
    able to manoeuvre from the centre outward, has been outgeneraled both in
    tactics and in strategy by Foch, so that the former's gains of terrain,
    while being of no advantage whatever—even a danger in certain sectors—have
    been purchased at an expenditure of men and material utterly incommensurate
    with their area and position.</p>

    <h3><a id="FORCING_THE_AISNE" name="FORCING_THE_AISNE"></a>FORCING THE
    AISNE</h3>

    <p>Ludendorff, on May 27, with a simultaneous diversion on the Lys salient
    and another at the southwest angle of the Picardy salient, northwest of
    Montdidier, began, with the most stupendous preparations ever concentrated,
    an attack on the southern barriers over a forty-mile front. He forced the
    Aisne the next day on an eighteen-mile front, and on May 31 he brought up
    at the Marne on a six-mile front, having made a penetration of thirty miles
    to the south. There he attempted to deploy both east and west, and was
    held.</p>

    <p>Meanwhile his baseline had been extended twenty miles to the west—to
    near Noyon. He had occupied about 650 square miles of new territory and had
    reduced his nearest approach to Paris from sixty-two to forty-four
    miles.</p>

    <p>Then, on June 9, with even a greater array of men and material, he
    attempted to invert the western bow-like side of the salient already formed
    by turning it outward. He made a fierce attack from a twenty-mile front
    between Montdidier and Noyon in the direction of Compiègne. With this
    objective attained, his Picardy front would have been sufficiently
    broadened to enable him to resume his journey down the Somme. Moreover, he
    would have been within striking distance of Paris. He gained seven miles,
    which was later reduced to less than six by French counterattacks. French
    counterattacks and a thrust of American marines on his flanks in the three
    succeeding days not only held him in a vise, but revealed his tremendous
    losses and the extraordinary means he had expended in preparations. By June
    12 his failure, the ramifications of which actually demonstrated his
    defeat, was an established fact. Then, on the following Saturday, June 15,
    this failure was acknowledged by the sudden launching of an Austrian
    offensive in Italy. How this was an acknowledgment we shall see in the
    proper place.</p>

    <h3><a id="SECOND_MARNE_BATTLE" name="SECOND_MARNE_BATTLE"></a>SECOND MARNE
    BATTLE</h3>

    <p>Held at the Ypres and Arras barriers in the north it was inevitable that
    Ludendorff's next move would be in the south. The railways freed by the
    expansion of the Picardy salient in March, the unhampered concentrations
    made possible at Péronne, St. Quentin, La Fère, and Hirson, and the
    admirable surface of the Laon Plateau for purposes of manoeuvring large
    bodies of troops—all pointed to the line northwest of Rheims as the
    probable point of attack. Then, when it came on May 27, consternation
    reigned among military critics as they observed the apparent ease with
    which the Germans carried, first, the mighty Chemin des Dames, protected on
    the east by Craonne and its three plateaux and on the west by the Ailette
    and the Oise, and then the south bank of the Aisne, with its formidable
    prepared fortifications at Soissons. The German feints in the Lys salient
    and before Amiens in the preceding week were said to have distracted Foch,
    who had thus been outgeneraled. And when the Marne was reached between
    Dormans and Château-Thierry, it was remembered how the Third German Army
    under General von Hausen had swept across the river at that identical spot
    on Aug. 25, 1914.</p>

    <p>In the first three days of the drive the Germans with the greatest
    auxiliary force of tanks, machine guns, and poison gas projectors they had
    ever mobilized employed twenty-five divisions, or 325,000 men. When they
    doubled their base line and had reached the Marne and were trying to deploy
    they were using forty divisions containing over 400,000 of their best
    troops. When the offensive quieted down in the first days of June it was
    estimated that they had lost fully 30 per cent. of the total in casualties.
    On <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11" name="Page_11">[Pg 11]</a></span>the
    other hand, they claimed to have captured over 45,000
    prisoners and taken 400 guns. They had come thirty miles and had occupied
    650 square miles of territory. But they were held.</p>

    <p>What is the explanation of this seeming paradox? Foch could by calling
    on a certain number of reserves easily have held the Chemin des Dames
    until—he had been flanked and enfiladed out, between Neufchatel and Rheims
    on the east and from the Oise where it enters the Aisne on the west. He
    might have held out longer on the southern bank of the Aisne, but the
    result would have been the same—losses equaling if not surpassing those of
    the enemy and the surrender of thousands of guns and large quantities of
    war material. Finally, he would have gained nothing and might even have
    been unable to hold the Marne.</p>

    <p>It is obvious that he did none of these things. But what did he do? He
    left his front protected by only sufficient men and guns to produce the
    greatest possible losses among the enemy as he slowly advanced south and
    concentrated heavily on the enemy's flanks. It was he and not Ludendorff
    who decreed that the Germans should reach the Marne between Dormans and
    Château-Thierry, and nowhere else. But it was Pétain who executed the plans
    of Foch.</p>

    <h3><a id="THE_FIGHT_IN_DETAIL" name="THE_FIGHT_IN_DETAIL"></a>THE FIGHT IN
    DETAIL</h3>

    <p>The German attack under the personal command of the Crown Prince
    launched on the morning of May 27 was mainly directed against the British
    8th, 50th, 25th, and 21st Divisions and the French 6th Army, which occupied
    the front from Vauxaillon eastward to the Brimont region—from north of
    Soissons to the north and a little west of Rheims. Certain sectors at once
    gave way under the strong pressure—particularly in the Chambrettes. There
    was no mistaking this for the main offensive, although in the Lys salient,
    between Ypres and Arras in the north, and on both sides of the Somme and
    the Ardre in the centre, there were simultaneous artillery preparations of
    great violence. Toward the end of the day the weight of the enemy's attacks
    carried his troops across both the River Aisne and the Chemin des Dames.
    The line, however, remained unbroken, as the Allies retreated across the
    Aisne between Vailly and Berry-au-Bac, which are eighteen miles apart, and
    then gave way across the Vesle near Fismes.</p>

    <p>On the 28th Franco-British troops proved the assault in the north to be
    abortive by quickly re-establishing their lines east of Dickebusch Lake and
    capturing a few prisoners. On the main field of battle in the south the
    Franco-British right deployed to the east covering the
    Brouillet-Savigny-Thillois line protecting Rheims. On the west they did the
    same, but with more elasticity, while the centre continued to give. On the
    29th the acute angle of the German penetration, with its vertex covering
    Fismes, suddenly sprung to the shape of a bow. The line still held covering
    the Cathedral City, but on the west the defenders of Soissons were killing
    their last Germans, and in the south Savigny on the Ardre had been reached.
    At Savigny the line of advance was diverted westward until it embraced
    Fère-en-Tardennois and Vezilly. And still the retreating but unbroken
    Allies were deploying east and west as its pressure increased, or were
    taken prisoner when retreat became impossible.</p>

    <p>On the 30th the enemy attempted to broaden his front northwest of Rheims
    and failed, but he succeeded in obliterating the salient south of Noyon,
    from the Oise Canal to Soissons, and on the 31st by an advance from a
    twenty-five-mile curved front he reached the Marne between Château-Thierry
    and Dormans on a contracted six-mile front. Here he met on the south bank
    the prepared defenses, and has been kept on the north bank ever since.</p>

    <h3><a id="AMERICAN_MARINES" name="AMERICAN_MARINES"></a>AMERICAN
    MARINES</h3>

    <p>In the enemy's attempts to broaden his front on the Marne salient, June
    1 and 2, he managed to rectify the eastern side by reaching Sarcy and Olizy
    and by working along up the Marne a couple of miles east of Dormans. He
    also measurably consolidated his positions between the Oise Canal and
    Soissons, and south of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12" name=
    "Page_12">[Pg 12]</a></span> the latter stretched the line into a segment
    with a five mile vertical as far south as, but not including,
    Château-Thierry on the Marne. This swing to the westward appears to have
    been a deliberate attempt to force Foch to meet shock with shock by
    throwing in his reserves, as the German advance had reached a point only
    forty miles from Paris.</p>

    <p>This was unnecessary, however, for here, north of Château-Thierry, the
    enemy was to meet a new foe—the American marines. It is doubtful whether
    the extraordinary performance of this corps and its French supports between
    June 6 and June 12, when they bent back the lower part of the bow between
    La Feste-Milon and Château-Thierry—from Grandeles, Champillon, and
    Clerembant Wood to Bussiares and Bouresches—can be <a id=
    "included_in_the_second_battle_of_the_Marne" name=
    "included_in_the_second_battle_of_the_Marne"></a>included in the second
    battle of the Marne or serves as a diversion to the later battle of the
    Oise, directed against Compiègne. At any rate, the ardor of the marines had
    the desired effect, for on the very day they began their work the inspired
    Berlin Vossische Zeitung said: "The German Supreme Command cannot well
    proceed now against the newly consolidated French front, which is richly
    provided with reserves, and bear the great losses which experience shows
    are entailed by such operations." Thus ended the second battle of the
    Marne, sometimes called the Aisne-Marne battle.</p>

    <h3><a id="BATTLE_OF_THE_OISE" name="BATTLE_OF_THE_OISE"></a>BATTLE OF THE
    OISE</h3>

    <p>The flanking lines between which the Germans were directed to the Marne
    made the battle of the Oise inevitable as far as the Marne salient was
    concerned. For the salient, there was only this alternative,<span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_13" name="Page_13">[Pg 13]</a></span> if its front
    could not be broadened: it must be "dug in" or be abandoned. But, being
    necessary, if it could be waged beyond a certain point, it would also
    become ambitious. It would supplement the Picardy front by continuing its
    line down to the Marne. Reaching the Oise at Montmacq, it would flank the
    French salient north of the Oise. Utilizing the Oise and Ourcq Valleys, it
    would envelop the defensive forests of Aigue, Compiègne, and
    Villers-Cotterets. This would mean Compiègne. From Compiègne the investment
    of Paris was possible.</p>

    <p>The battle, as far as the Germans are concerned, was probably their most
    disastrous effort of the war within the given time. Between thirty and
    thirty-four divisions were completely used up—a cost of over 400,000
    effectives. Not only did their advance lack the element of surprise, but it
    entered a veritable trap. Their front was enfiladed with a destructive fire
    from impregnable flanks.</p>

    <p>The battle was also a revelation; it demonstrated as nothing else the
    waning man power of the enemy—the desperate mobilization of 16-year-old
    boys, of old men, of convicts, even.</p>

    <p>The artillery preparation, rich in gas shells, began at midnight on June
    8-9. On the following morning at 4:30 the attack was launched over the
    twenty miles from Montdidier to Noyon. And, as usual, there was the
    northern diversion—the pounding of the British lines by gunfire from
    Villers-Bretonneux to Arras. Even on the first day of the assault, when the
    German centre advanced two and a half miles, the French made a spirited
    counterattack near Hautebraye, between the Aisne and the Oise. On the
    second day the enemy took at tremendous cost the villages of Mery, Belloy,
    and St. Maur and debouched from Thiescourt Wood. On the third day, with the
    aid of four fresh divisions, he managed to reach the Aronde, on the west;
    to descend a mile astride the Matz and to occupy its northern bank almost
    to the Oise, in the centre; and to envelop the forest of Ourscamps, on the
    east. Before the sun set the French, by a counterattack, had entirely won
    back the gains on the west, with over 1,000 prisoners captured. On the
    fourth and fifth days (June 13 and 14) the French heavily attacked on the
    flanks of the centre—at Courcelles and at Croix Ricard. Then came two final
    kicks from the foe; on June 16 he attempted to cross the Matz near its
    junction with the Oise and was driven back with heavy losses. The next day
    he drenched the south bank of the Marne with gas shells, but did not
    attempt to cross the stream.</p>

    <p>All this time abortive diversions had been going on in the north, in the
    Lys salient, where on June 15 the British and Scottish troops took the
    initiative and captured two miles of enemy positions seven miles west of La
    Bassée and just north of Béthune.</p>

    <h3><a id="THE_AUSTRIAN_OFFENSIVE" name="THE_AUSTRIAN_OFFENSIVE"></a>THE
    AUSTRIAN OFFENSIVE</h3>

    <p>Just as the German defeat on the Marne and Oise was beginning to be
    realized abroad—its losses calculated, its meaning interpreted—the
    Austrians, on June 15, suddenly launched an offensive in the mountain
    region of Veneto and from the left bank of the Piave. So far the enemy has
    been firmly held in the mountains, but has crossed the river at two places
    without, however, being able to bring over any effective artillery—on the
    middle reaches he has gained the Plateau of Montello, defended by the
    intrenchments prepared there by the British under Plumer last December, and
    near the mouth he has succeeded in establishing one or two bridgeheads in
    the vicinity of Capo Sile.</p>

    <p>As a military proposition the offensive has lacked the so far inevitable
    successes of a prepared initiative; in the mountains the first attacks were
    almost instantly broken up by simultaneous counterattacks. Along the river,
    especially in the vicinity of the crossings, the battle is developing in
    scope and intensity.</p>

    <p>Aside from the military paradox already noted, this offensive possesses
    several characteristics, some military, some political, which seem well
    worth while dwelling upon.</p>

    <p>In the first place, the location of the active front east of the Lago di
    Garda, from the Asiago Plateau to the sea, offers <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_14" name="Page_14">[Pg 14]</a></span>a certain
    indication of the German military situation in France. Its abortive
    character may also indicate the political situation in Austria-Hungary.
    With the lines in the mountains held, the operations on the Piave present
    no formidable danger to Italy.</p>

    <p>It was well known by the Italian General Staff that the Austro-German
    High Command intended to make the attempt to confirm the Italian disaster
    of Caporetto as soon as the melting of the snows permitted the
    transportation of men and supplies through the Alps. In the first place,
    the material and man power lost by the Italians in the retreat to the
    Piave, which included the actual elimination of the 2d Army, were replaced.
    In the second, it was absolutely necessary to rectify, even in the Winter,
    the northern mountain line east of the Lago di Garda. West of the lake up
    to the Tonale Pass, over the great glacier of the Adamello, it was
    practically invulnerable, save through the Giudicaria Valley.</p>

    <p>From west to east there were three doors, as it were, which had only
    been partly shut—the Vallarsa south of Rovereto, the path of the Frenzela
    Torrent and the angle it forms with the Brenta just above Valstagna, and
    the approach down the Piave in the region of Monte Monfenera from the
    Calcina Torrent. There were also other minor openings—the passes of Monte
    Asolone, between the Brenta and the Piave, covering the path south along
    the Val San Lorenzo, the Nos and Campo Mulo Valleys between Asiago and the
    Brenta. All these were closed in December and January, with a total loss to
    the enemy of over 10,000 men and 100 guns, save the domination of the
    Vallarsa, that was taken from the Austrians by the capture of Monte Corno
    on May 15. Meanwhile, the British and French armies had been transferred,
    the former from Il Montello on the Piave to the Asiago Plateau, and the
    latter from the Monfenera region to that of Monte Grappa. Between 200,000
    and 300,000 Italian troops had been sent to the aid of France.</p>

    <p>Thus the Italian General Staff awaited the inevitable with confidence—a
    confidence fully seconded by people and press, for if the mass of the
    Italians had fought in ignorance before the catastrophe of Caporetto, since
    then they had learned the objects of the war—national as well as
    allied.</p>

    <p>But the General Staff had also learned something else. This was most
    important. If Ludendorff in France should be successful—if he should
    succeed in isolating the allied armies north of the Somme, or force the
    French back upon the defenses of Paris, or both—then the Austrian Commander
    in Chief with his million men would be aided by German generalship and
    German divisions, and, together, they would strike down the Giudicaria to
    the west of the Lago di Garda, with all strength and disregarding all
    sacrifices in order to reach the metallurgic centre of Italy in Lombardia
    and Emilia, thereby forcing Italy out of the war and gaining access to the
    back door of France. If, however, Ludendorff should be blocked in France,
    the offensive must still be made at the propitious moment, but its plan of
    attack would be to the east of the Lago di Garda, from the Astico to the
    sea. It would be entirely an Austrian affair, and would naturally be
    limited by the political and military situation in the Dual Monarchy.</p>

    <p>It is of significance, therefore, that the offensive has been launched
    to the east and not to the west of the Lago di Garda. Its locality reveals
    Ludendorff's conviction that he is at least blocked in France, if nothing
    else, whatever light its development may later throw upon the parlous
    internal conditions of the Hapsburg Empire.</p>

    <p>This admitted, the Austrian plan of campaign becomes a simple
    problem—simple because there could be no other. At the beginning of the war
    Italy attempted to neutralize the Trentino and the Carnic region by sealing
    the passes and then made her attack across the Isonzo. But she could never
    be certain that the passes had been effectually sealed. A successful
    Austrian invasion through them would jeopardize her armies on the Isonzo,
    isolate them by cutting their lines of communication. That was the danger
    which threatened those armies when the Austrians made their drive upon the
    Asiago Plateau in May, 1916, which was ultimately outflanked and forced
    back. That was also the disaster when last October the Austro-German
    armies, having penetrated the Isonzo line from the north, forced it to
    retire westward, forced a withdrawal from the passes in the Carnic and the
    Dolomite Alps, and again reached the Asiago Plateau, this time free from
    the danger of being flanked.<br /></p>

    <p>It is thus of most vital influence upon the operations going on along
    the Piave that the British on the Asiago Plateau, on June 15, and the
    French on Monte Grappa, the next day, and the Italians elsewhere even
    covering a diversion at the Tonale Pass, should have hurled back with
    severe losses the initial assaults of the enemy in the mountain regions. On
    June 18 the Austrians claimed to have taken 30,000 prisoners and 120 guns
    since the 15th; the Italians and their allies claimed 2,500 prisoners.</p>

    Bulgar-German troops on the Struma front in Macedonia. Meanwhile, however,
    General Guillaumat, who succeeded General Sarrail as commander of the
    allied armies there in December, has returned to France to take charge of
    the defenses of Paris.</p>

    </a>The Astounding German Order for Fraternization and Penetration on the
    Italian Front</h3>

    <p>The April issue of <span class="smcap">Current History Magazine</span>
    contained the text of a German order for undermining the morale of Russian
    troops by fraternization. Early in May a similar order was found on a
    German prisoner captured by French troops on the Italian front. The order
    is as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p class="smcap">281st Division, First Section, No.
        226.—Confidential.</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic">Not to be communicated to troops in the
        first line.</p>

        <p>First—Following the telephone order, Geroch No. 2,080, you are asked
        to intensify with efficacy the propaganda with the enemy army.</p>

        <p>Second—The object of this propaganda is to disorganize the enemy
        army and to obtain information regarding it. The propaganda must be
        carried out in the following manner: (a) By throwing into the enemy's
        trenches newspapers and proclamations destined for the more intelligent
        elements; (b) by persuading the troops by oral propaganda. For that it
        will be necessary to utilize officers, under-officers, and soldiers who
        appear to be most adapted. The posts for making contacts with the enemy
        must be placed under the direction of the company commander, who must
        be in the first-line positions. These officers must ascertain the
        points where it will be the easiest to throw into the enemy trenches
        newspapers, proclamations, &amp;c. At these points you must seek to
        gain contact with the enemy by means of our interpreters, and if the
        enemy consents then fix an hour for future conversations. You must then
        advise immediately by telephone the chief of the Information Bureau of
        the division of every contact with the enemy.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Only the chief of the Information Bureau will have the right to
        direct the conversations according to the instructions he has received.
        It is rigorously prohibited for any of our soldiers to enter into
        relation with the enemy except those who have received the mission to
        do so, for fear that the enemy may seek to profit by their
        ingenuousness. All letters and printed matter which the enemy may have
        on his person must be taken from him, and transmitted to the chief of
        the Information Bureau. Company commanders, above all, must seek to
        establish the points where the enemy's soldiers have received
        newspapers, the points where the newspapers were taken openly, and
        without precaution. There are posts of observation for the artillery,
        as it may happen that French officers or foreign army instructors are
        in these posts.</p>

        <p>In these enterprises for obtaining contact with the enemy, success
        depends on the ability with which you operate. Good results can be
        obtained by calling in a friendly tone and indicating sentiments of
        comradeship or by reiterated promises not to fire and offers of
        tobacco. The tobacco for this purpose will be furnished by the company
        commanders.</p>

        <p>Every evening, at 8 o'clock, the company commander must transmit
        directly to the information officer a report of the propaganda
        accomplished during the day. This report must contain the following
        indications: (a) Has the enemy picked up our newspapers and
        proclamations? (b) Have you endeavored to enter into relations with the
        enemy? (c) With whom have you had contact—officers, under-officers,
        soldiers? (d) Where and when were our newspapers and proclamations
        thrown into the enemy's trenches? (e) All other information of the
        enemy's conduct. At the same time, our interpreters will send to the
        chief of the Information Bureau a detailed report on all conversations
        they have had with the enemy. The enemy's positions where propaganda is
        under way must not be shelled by our artillery; they must indicate to
        the batteries the positions of these points to be spared. The enemy is
        perfidious and without honor, and it is necessary as a consequence to
        be careful that they neither take our propagandists prisoners nor kill
        them. Those of our soldiers who leave our lines for the purpose of
        carrying newspapers and pamphlets to the enemy must be advised. To
        protect them it will be necessary to constitute with care special
        detachments, who will mount guard in the trenches, and who will fire
        only on the order of the company commander who is directing relations
        with the enemy.—Signed, on behalf of the temporary commander of the
        division, the Major General commanding the 62d Brigade.</p>

        GERMAN OFFENSIVE</h2>

        <p>Third Month of Desperate Effort to Break the French and British
        Lines in France</p>

        <p>By GEORGE H. PERRIS</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic">Special Correspondent with the French
        Armies</p>

        <p>[Copyrighted in the United States of America]</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic">The May and June issue of Current History
        Magazine contained detailed descriptions of the first and second months
        of the great German offensive in France, which began with a terrific
        blow in Picardy, apparently with the object of driving a wedge between
        the French and British, and then shifted to a deadly attack on the
        British in Flanders, aiming to break through to the Channel ports.
        These phases of the great battle were described by Philip Gibbs. The
        new phases, sometimes called the third and fourth offensives, began May
        27 and June 9, respectively, and are known as the battle for Paris and
        the battle of the Oise. The blow of May 27 was delivered between Rheims
        and Montdidier, with the evident purpose of breaking the French lines
        and clearing the way for a drive to Paris. The descriptions which
        follow are written by George H. Perris, a special correspondent with
        the French armies.</p>

        <p>[This dispatch was written before the drive toward Paris was
        launched, and indicates that Mr. Perris had a clear and correct idea of
        the German plan]</p>

        <p>May 26, 1918.—The delay of the third act of the German offensive was
        abnormal. The first was perhaps, in design and execution, the most
        powerful operation in the history of warfare. The second, the attack in
        Flanders in the middle week of April, almost certainly began as a
        diversion intended to draw the British reserves from the Amiens front
        and to fill the interval needed for the reorganization of forces.</p>

        <p>Up to the middle of April the German armies not occupied in fighting
        could do little but commence the strengthening of their new fronts, as
        lines of defense and departure. Their staffs, high and low, must,
        however, have been already engaged upon plans for the next push. Six or
        seven weeks then have passed in constituting a new mass of attack, with
        its armament and transport, in constructing roads and railways, dumps
        and supply centres, in bringing forward batteries, airdromes,
        hospitals, and so on.</p>

        <p>True, this is not as long as the time of preparation for the first
        phase of the battle, which may be broadly counted as from New Year's to
        March 21. But there should be a vast difference between the mounting of
        a wholly fresh offensive and its pursuit into the later stages. A
        relentless continuity of pressure is evidently of very great importance
        after the advantage of the initial surprise. It is the thing which a
        commander will most aim at.</p>

        <p>If the Germans did not keep going on the main line of their attack
        north and south of the Somme after the middle of April, it was because
        they could not do so; and the partial success of their ex-temporized
        campaign in Flanders should not disguise from us this significant
        fact.</p>

        <p>It would be useless at this period of the war, when all Germany
        demands a decision and nothing less, if the new offensive did not lead
        to the capture at least of some place of symbolic importance, such as
        Rheims, Verdun, or Nancy. But that would require a force so large as to
        cripple the major effort in the northwest. All the military virtue of
        the German strategy is against such a dispersal of effort.</p>

        <h3><a id="CHEMIN_DES_DAMES_LOST" name=
        "CHEMIN_DES_DAMES_LOST"></a>CHEMIN DES DAMES LOST</h3>

        <p><i>May 28</i>—<i>The opening of the attack and the first day's
        results are thus described by Mr. Perris</i>:</p>

        <p>Hindenburg has scored another spectacular success. At dawn
        yesterday, after three hours' bombardment, composed largely of gas
        shells, a new German mass attack was thrown upon a twenty-five-mile
        front, extending from the Ailette near Vauxaillon to the Aisne-Marne
        Canal near Brimont.</p>

        <p>It was four or five times as numerous as the defenders, and in other
        regards correspondingly stronger. In these circumstances, an attempt to
        retain the line of the Chemin des Dames would have meant that the
        French troops would have been massacred before reserves could reach
        them, and there was nothing for it but to fall back steadily and in
        good order, using successive lines of trenches and deep folds of ground
        to punish the enemy for every forward step he made.</p>

        <p>As I anticipated in my last message, the method of the first phase
        of the German offensive was again employed with some improvements. This
        method rests upon two main elements—the prodigal expenditure of the
        large reserves obtained by the collapse of Russia and Rumania, and the
        skillful use of the great advantage of what are called interior lines
        of communication to throw a mass attack suddenly upon the chosen
        sector, and so to gain the further advantage of surprise.</p>

        <p>The front now chosen was held till a day or two ago by parts of two
        armies belonging to the group of which the Prussian Crown Prince is the
        titular chief. General von Boehm's army, extending from the Oise at
        Noyon to east of Craonne, numbered nine divisions. In the sector of
        General Fritz von Below, extending across the Rheims front to Suippe,
        near Auberive, there were eight divisions. The whole twenty-five miles
        attacked yesterday had therefore been held till the eve of battle by
        only seven or eight divisions. The exact number of divisions engaged
        yesterday is not yet known, but it seems to have been about
        twenty-five, or over a quarter of a million combatants.</p>

        <p>There is here a curious difference and likeness as compared with the
        first phase of the offensive on March 21. To the seventeen divisions
        already holding the sector of attack there were added another
        seventeen. This time the same number has been added where there were
        only eight. Two months ago the front of attack was about forty miles
        long. This time a rather denser force was employed, perhaps because the
        Aisne height constituted a formidable position, and it was intended to
        carry it at a single rush.</p>

        <p>While the front keeps its present shape the German staff has
        necessarily a great advantage over that of the Allies in that it is
        acting from the centre of a crescent, and they are around and outside
        of it. If enough time can be given to preparations—and as my last
        message showed the pause had been abnormal—they must gain a certain
        benefit of surprise, and with this benefit such a mass of shock must
        win a certain depth of ground.</p>

        <p>Our only notions of the Chemin des Dames were obtained in a time
        very different from the present emergency, the time of fixed fronts and
        of methods defensive and offensive that are already old-fashioned to
        those of us who have watched these blood-soaked hills and gullies for
        nearly four years through heartrending vicissitudes, who remember
        Haig's and Smith-Dorrien's first attempts to scale what seemed an
        impregnable fortress, who saw the French bluecoats rush forward last
        Summer till at length they stood firm on the cliffs of Craonne and
        Heurtebise, who explored the Dragon's Cave at Malmaison Fort and the
        vast Montparnasse quarry when they still stank from rotting flesh.</p>

        should be lost. It seems only the other day that I was adventuring
        along the Ailette by Anizyle-Château, sleeping in a dugout in Pinon
        Forest, and examining the outposts that then held the northern edge of
        the hills.</p>

        <p>War pays little regard to sentiment, and it is not any spectacular
        stroke or sentimental score that will restore the falling fortunes of

        <p>No doubt the French command found it grievous yesterday to order a
        retreat to the Aisne. Feebler men might have temporized and lost in
        doing so many good lives which are, after all, more sacred than the
        most sacred earth.</p>

        <p>The attack could not be anticipated. It was far beyond the powers of
        the small defending forces to ward it off. With sound tactical sense
        the heaviest assault was directed toward the eastern end of the Aisne
        Hills at Craonne as soon as it became evident that this corner could
        not be held, and that from here the whole line was in danger of being
        turned.</p>

        <p>The German forces included some of the specially trained units that
        fought in von Hutier's army in the March attack—two divisions of the
        Prussian Guard and other crack formations. It was only at heavy cost
        that they got forward so quickly. The French retired from position to
        position without confusion, firing continuously. The fact that their
        losses are small in comparison with those of the enemy is an essential
        point.</p>

        <h3><a id="THE_SECOND_DAY" name="THE_SECOND_DAY"></a>THE SECOND
        DAY</h3>

        <p>May 29—There has been very severe fighting today, with results
        necessarily favorable on the whole to the enemy because the allied
        reserves are only just beginning to reach the front. A strong thrust
        toward Soissons and the road and railway from Soissons to
        Coucy-le-Château at the moment when the head of the columns of the
        offensive were striking south of the Vesle from Braisne, Bazoches, and
        Fismes suggests that the armies engaged have already been reinforced.
        [See maps in preceding pages.]</p>

        <p>So far an almost insolent boldness has won through, but the French
        resistance is steadily increasing, and more prudence will soon be
        necessary. For instance, the River Aisne is a most awkward obstacle to
        have on your line of communications. The enemy was able to prevent the
        Allies from destroying all the bridges during the withdrawal, but it is
        not too late, and the bombarding squadrons of the Allies will doubtless
        find telling work to do in the early future.</p>

        <p>Last evening when the enemy had got across the Aisne near Pontavert
        part of the British brigade was falling back. A group of French
        territorials, firing continuously upon the swarming graycoats, were
        taking refuge in Germicourt Wood and being gradually surrounded. Some
        Englishmen and older Frenchmen decided to make their last stand, to die
        there together or to beat the enemy off. A handful of territorials got
        away to tell the tale. The Englishmen fell to a man.</p>

        <p>The French officer who told me of this episode of the battle spoke
        also of the gallant work of a British cyclist battalion fighting with
        the French before Fismes, and of the fate of some British officers who
        lost their lives in blowing up Aisne bridges near Craonne. There was no
        time to take the usual precautions, but the thing had to be done, and
        they did it. My informant showed that he felt all the nobility and
        pathos of these sacrifices, and he wished, as much as I, that the folk
        at home should hear of them.</p>

        <p>The first reports seemed to indicate that the success of the German
        assault on the British sector led the defenders by a threat of
        envelopment to retreat from the Aisne heights. This was not so. The
        Germans first crossed the river further west, and the British left was
        therefore obliged to fall back.</p>

        <h3><a id="TERRIBLE_BOMBARDMENT" name=
        "TERRIBLE_BOMBARDMENT"></a>TERRIBLE BOMBARDMENT</h3>

        <p>It was the left, and particularly the 50th Division, that had to
        bear the heaviest of the shock. The bombardment, which lasted three
        hours, was of indescribable intensity, the chill night air being soon
        saturated with poison gas, and when at dawn the German infantry,
        hideous in their masks, broke like a tidal wave upon the thin British
        line it was overwhelmed. The 50th is a territorial division.</p>

        <p>A counterattack toward Craonne failed under a flank fire from tanks
        and machine guns, and step by step the heroic line was withdrawn
        through wooded and marshy ground to the Aisne.</p>

        <p>The French on the left were resisting like masses with the same
        bravery; contact was lost with them for a short time,<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_21" name="Page_21">[Pg 21]</a></span> as also
        with the British 25th and 8th Divisions further east, and as the men
        fell back a front could be preserved only by a converging retreat
        toward the south by night. When the hills north of Vosle were reached
        the 50th Division had lost a number of its officers and other
        ranks.</p>

        <p>The British centre, consisting of part of the 25th and 8th
        Divisions, was more fortunate. The 25th had been in reserve, and its
        support in the low and difficult ground at the east end of the Aisne
        Valley was most important. It and the 8th maintained their second
        positions till late in the afternoon.</p>

        <p>On the right the 21st Division, together with the neighboring French
        division, had to defend the line of the canal from Berry-au-Bac to
        Bermericourt against the onset of four German divisions, aided by the
        strongest fleet of tanks the enemy has yet put into the field. This
        northwestern edge of the great plain of Champagne is very favorable
        ground for the use of cars of assault, and it was here that the French
        made their first experiments with indifferent results that have since
        been greatly bettered.</p>

        <p>These two British and French divisions had the advantage of a line
        of heights with batteries and perfect observation behind them. They
        held out obstinately till the retreat of the left made it necessary to
        move southward.</p>

        <h3><a id="DESTRUCTION_OF_SOISSONS" name=
        "DESTRUCTION_OF_SOISSONS"></a>DESTRUCTION OF SOISSONS</h3>

        <p>May 30.—During last night the enemy took Fère-en-Tardenois and drove
        the allied rearguards back to Vesilly, whence the line ran this morning
        northeast to the outskirts of Rheims. As the Marne is thus brought into
        the picture, it is pertinent to point out that in the famous battle of
        September, 1914, the Germans reached to more than thirty miles south of
        the river in this region.</p>

        <p>This is at present their strongest push. The road from Soissons to
        Compiègne is closed to them, but further south they have got to the
        road Soissons-Hartennes.</p>

        <p>Lest it be thought that the allied reserves are slow in coming into
        play, I may point out that the front of the offensive has been nearly
        doubled in length in the last three days. At the outset it was about
        thirty-five miles. It is now sixty. Merely to make good losses and to
        provide a screen of troops along this greater extent, with everything
        in movement, has required effort.</p>

        <p>At midnight on May 26 the battlefront was ten miles away from
        Soissons. The few civilian inhabitants and the many hospital patients
        had settled down to sleep, the usual hour for airplane raids having
        passed.</p>

        <p>An hour later they and the few army bureaus in the neighborhood were
        aroused by a sudden outbreak of bombardment, such as they had never
        heard before, and soon afterward shells began to crash upon the
        town.</p>

        <p>With the wounds of four years of war upon it, the northern quarter
        completely destroyed and the cathedral grievously damaged, Soissons
        still possessed something of its old-time grace and air of substantial
        well being. It would be an exaggeration to compare it with Richmond,
        for the Aisne is not the Thames and the French woods are not English
        parks; but after the victory of Malmaison had put the boche back beyond
        the Ailette we hoped to see the great mansions repaired and the happy
        life of the shopping quarters gradually revived. Today the Germans are
        camped in the smoking ruins of Soissons.</p>

        <h3><a id="INCENDIARY_SHELLS" name="INCENDIARY_SHELLS"></a>INCENDIARY
        SHELLS</h3>

        <p>On May 27 at least 1,200 explosive and incendiary shells were fired
        into the place. The hospitals, including a special hospital for poison
        gas cases, were hurriedly evacuated, American ambulance cars doing good
        service in carrying away the wounded.</p>

        <p>On Tuesday, the 28th, the bombardment continued, its purpose being,
        no doubt, to put out of service the most important bridgehead of the
        Aisne Valley and one of the most important lines of communication
        between the regions to the south and north, the town being a railway
        centre of some local consequence. That afternoon a good many houses
        were in flames, and during the night a large part of the town was
        involved in fire.</p>

        <p>The enemy had now shouldered his way on the north of the Aisne
        westward from Pinon, Laffaux, and Vregny, and had reached the highroad
        running from Coucy-le-Château to Soissons. Yesterday he pressed still
        further west, and the road being thus covered, as well as the roads
        from Laffaux and Vailly, made a powerful direct attack upon the
        town.</p>

        <p>It looked at first like being an easy success. The French, wearied
        with thirty hours of unceasing combat and impossibly outnumbered, fell
        back, and the Germans reached the centre of the town. In the narrow
        streets, however, the effect of superior numbers largely disappeared.
        The French fought fiercely from corner to corner, and at last,
        gathering themselves together, swept the<span class="pagenum"><a id=
        "Page_22" name="Page_22">[Pg 22]</a></span> enemy back to the northern
        and eastern suburbs. In the afternoon new German contingents were
        brought up and in a few hours gained complete possession of the
        place.</p>

        <p>Soissons was, of course, in no sense fortified, and, the northern
        and eastern roads having been lost, it had no military value. The
        highway down the valley to Compiègne is bordered by the old French
        trench and wire systems and dominated by hills on either side of the
        river. The range on the south bank is covered for miles by the great
        forests of Villers-Cotterets and Compiègne.</p>

        <p>[Another correspondent stated that 1,200 shells fell in Soissons on
        May 27. The Bishop of Soissons stated in Paris on June 7 that 100
        churches had been razed to the ground by the Germans, and that at least
        100 others had been pillaged and partially demolished. The famous
        cathedral in Soissons suffered severely. The Bishop added that the
        Germans knew neither faith nor law. They knew nothing but war and
        pillage. The Germans, he said, were stripping and carrying everything
        away methodically.</p>

        <p>The Bishop also asserted that women, children, and old men had been
        brutally murdered by German aviators, who flew over and fired with
        their machine guns upon long lines of refugees on country roads.]</p>

        <h3><a id="VON_HUTIERS_METHOD" name="VON_HUTIERS_METHOD"></a>VON
        HUTIER'S METHOD</h3>

        <p>Something like forty divisions, most of them the best troops
        available, have now been thrown across the Aisne—400,000 men who might
        possibly have reached some vital part of the allied defenses in the
        north.</p>

        <p>The von Hutier method is a prodigious invention, but it is as costly
        in fire and blood as it is impressive for force and speed. In the last
        week of March it was, in a purely military sense, properly employed,
        even though it failed, because the objective could be said to be of a
        vital or decisive character.</p>

        <p>What vital objective is there in the present operation? The central
        part of the German line has been pressed a little further in the last
        twenty-four hours in the obscure region of scattered hamlets, large
        farms, and deep tortuous valleys, midway between the Aisne and the
        Marne. It now comes nearly down to the small market towns of
        Fère-en-Tardenois and Ville-en-Tardenois, thence running east-northeast
        to the Vesle just outside of Rheims.</p>

        <p>The advance is meeting everincreasing resistance, and by the time
        the first week is out it will perhaps be definitely arrested. But
        suppose that it goes much further and reaches the Marne Valley, or even
        still further to the Montmirail Valley. Two useful highroads, with some
        country towns, would be lost to the Allies in these altogether unlikely
        contingencies, but nothing vital would be lost. The German Army would
        be no nearer than it now is to winning the war.</p>

        <h3><a id="A_TRAIN_UNDER_FIRE" name="A_TRAIN_UNDER_FIRE"></a>A TRAIN
        UNDER FIRE</h3>

        <p>In an evacuation station, where a number of British were waiting for
        the hospital train, the ragged fellows told me of adventures that only
        their scarlet, honest faces made credible. There was a young Lieutenant
        who was on a train that was sent up north yesterday toward Fismes. The
        exact whereabouts of the enemy was unknown. They ran right into the
        German lines.</p>

        <p>The outposts received them with a volley of rifle shots and then
        came on with grenades. The engine driver stopped the train, jumped
        down, and took refuge in a ditch. While the fight waxed hotter he was
        induced to return, and they managed to steam backward just in time,
        carrying some wounded and three German prisoners with them. The
        Lieutenant's satisfaction in this last item seemed, however, to be
        marred by the impression that the Germans were not forcibly captured,
        but wished to surrender.</p>

        <p>The civilian refugees are going south in processions of farm carts,
        high-ended wagons, and ancient traps, or footing it behind barrows and
        perambulators. I would not speak lightly of the temporary loss of their
        lands and homes, but in their ranks there was no sign of panic or fear
        for the final result.</p>

        <p>Most of them were women and children, with a few gaffers, heading a
        family group or driving cows and big white oxen. Girls with umbrellas
        up against the hot sun and dust clouds, little children in their Sunday
        best, and old ladies in Scotch caps sat on piles of straw, amid bedding
        and furniture, on high wagons. Many of the younger folks had bicycles
        and many walked, with dogs and goats frisking about them.</p>

        <h3><a id="EXTENSION_OF_THE_BATTLE" name=
        "EXTENSION_OF_THE_BATTLE"></a>EXTENSION OF THE BATTLE</h3>

        <p><i>On May 31 Mr. Perris described the extension of the battlefront
        during the preceding twenty-four hours. He wrote</i>:</p>

        <p>The battlefront now forms a vast triangle, the apex pointing
        markedly toward Château-Thierry and less markedly toward Dormans. The
        west side runs for about fifty miles from the Oise opposite Noyon to
        the Marne. The east side runs back thirty miles to Rheims.</p>

        <p>The enemy goes on multiplying his objective and distending his
        lines. The military worth of this strategy is perhaps in inverse ratio
        to its shown appearance on the map.</p>

        <p>On the opposite flanks of the battlefield the allied forces have
        here been drawn slightly back from the acute salient, marked by the two
        trivial points named in a previous message, Betheny and Laneuvillette.
        The ruins of Rheims thus become the corner of the allied defenses on
        this line. I have explained that the city lies exposed in a saucer at
        the southwestern corner of the Champagne and is completely dominated by
        the allied crescent<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23" name=
        "Page_23">[Pg 23]</a></span> of high positions on the mountains of
        Rheims.</p>

        <h3><a id="FIRM_ON_THE_FLANKS" name="FIRM_ON_THE_FLANKS"></a>FIRM ON
        THE FLANKS</h3>

        <p>In contrast with the further advance of the German centre, the
        French and British forces on the wings are holding firm. The great
        highroad from Soissons to Château-Thierry marks broadly the western
        limit of the offensive.</p>

        <p>On the northern stretch of it there was hard fighting yesterday. In
        the morning the enemy crossed the road at Hartennes and attacked
        westward with a number of tanks, but was checked near the hamlet of
        Tigny.</p>

        <p>Further north a well known French division made, with its
        traditional spirit, a thrust westward across the road and the little
        River Crise and reached the village of Noyant. It had to fall back, but
        here, too, the German advance was arrested. The Compiègne road is
        firmly held, and the disparity of forces is being rapidly reduced.</p>

        <p>On the other flank of the battlefield the French and British
        divisions stand across the hills on the other bank of the Ardre, a
        small tributary of the Vesle, from Brouillet to Thillois, on the
        northern foothills of the mountain of Rheims, whence the front runs
        around the ruined city.</p>

        <p>This French division struck out from Le Neuvillette along the canal
        and captured two hummocks, called Castalliers and De Courcy. It was a
        bold effort, intended to check the enemy rather than in the hope of
        retaining the position. This indeed proved impossible, but the French
        were slow to retire, and the lesson will not be lost upon their
        adversaries.</p>

        <h3><a id="FIGHT_TO_THE_DEATH" name="FIGHT_TO_THE_DEATH"></a>FIGHT TO
        THE DEATH</h3>

        <p>The news is gradually coming in of what happened on the front,
        submerged by the assault of Monday morning, (May 27.) Its most
        northerly part was the low ground beside the Ailette called the Forest
        of Pinon, which I described fully last Christmas, when I spent several
        days with the outposts by which it was held, in conditions somewhat
        reminiscent of Wild West warfare. The nearest trenches were on the
        hills a mile or two behind, this ground being too marshy to dig in. In
        the forest blockhouses were then being built, and were laid out while
        each side raided the other across the frontier on the stream and canal.
        Nothing then seemed less likely than an attack across such ground, but
        preparations were being pushed forward with the idea that a few groups
        of defenders would gather in and around the blockhouses and fight a
        delaying action, and then, if possible, escape back to the hill
        trenches.</p>

        <p>The event turned out otherwise. When the surviving groups and
        outposts, amounting in all to three battalions, got together on Monday
        morning they decided to intrench themselves and to fight to the death.
        Carrier pigeons brought notes from them to this effect. The last note
        received was dated 2 P. M. on Tuesday. The best that can be hoped is
        that some survive as prisoners.</p>

        <p>I think it may be said that there is now no danger of a break
        through toward any vital objective.</p>

        <h3><a id="STRONGER_RESISTANCE" name="STRONGER_RESISTANCE"></a>STRONGER
        RESISTANCE</h3>

        <p><i>Mr. Perris on June 2 gave the first hint of improved aspects of
        the battle in the following dispatch</i>:</p>

        <p>On Friday afternoon, May 31, General von Boehm's troops opened a new
        pocket beyond Oulchy of a depth of about five miles and on either side
        of the Ourcq Valley yesterday. In the course of stubborn fighting this
        salient was slightly extended, and at the same time a narrow bend was
        added to their gains between the Oise about Pont Eveque and the Aisne
        west of Soissons.</p>

        <p>The main line of pressure was thus changed from south to southwest,
        and while the rest of the new front is relatively quiet, there have
        developed two bulges, which represent the acutest stress of the
        battle.</p>

        <p>The first of these is between the Oise and the Aisne, directed
        toward the angle of the two rivers at Compiègne; the second, midway
        between the Aisne and the Marne, points westward along the Ourcq,
        toward the ancient town of Laferte-Milon.</p>

        <p>In both these fields there has been a series of violent struggles
        this morning, with a notable increase of the power of resistance of the
        Allies. North of the Aisne the German assaults have been nearly
        everywhere broken. A slight advance by the Germans on the Ourcq has
        been won at the cost of very heavy losses, and the French are standing
        with splendid resolution along its small tributary, the Savieres, which
        marks the border of the forest region of Villers-Cotterets.</p>

        <p>As the enemy has reached the heights northwest of Château-Thierry,
        where we watch them from the south side of the river, an attempt to
        push westward along the north bank of the Marne is to be expected.</p>

        <h3><a id="THE_ADVANCE_CHECKED" name="THE_ADVANCE_CHECKED"></a>THE
        ADVANCE CHECKED</h3>

        <p><i>On June 3 Mr Perris was more optimistic than at any time since
        the battle began. He wrote as follows</i>:</p>

        <p>There is a slackening in the violence of the battle. Yesterday's
        fighting was the most equal I have seen in this stage of the offensive.
        We lost Faverolles again—this village has since been recaptured—but
        regained Hill 163, just west of the village of Passy, and broke attacks
        against Corcy, Troesnes, and Torcy. It is to be expected that the enemy
        will make new efforts to destroy the French bastion on the bare
        plateaus between the Aisne and the Ourcq.</p>

        <p>Local currents of fortune are also in the nature of things,
        according as one side or the other decides to throw its local
        reserves<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24" name="Page_24">[Pg
        24]</a></span> upon this or that point. So far as the intentions of the
        German command have been revealed, however, it may now be said that the
        position is in hand at the end of the first week of this third act of
        the German offensive.</p>

        <p>What is the outlook? By lengthy preparation aimed at an unlikely
        sector the enemy gained ground to nearly as large an extent as in the
        first act. In the last week of March von Hutier pierced from St.
        Quentin to Montdidier, say, thirty-five miles. In the last week von
        Boehm advanced from the Ailette to Château-Thierry, about thirty miles,
        on a similar length of front. It is too early to attempt comparison of
        the cost of the two enterprises in losses and exhaustion.</p>

        <p>The German staff seems to have counted on employing forty-five
        divisions in the Aisne offensive. Before the end of last week this
        figure had been exceeded. No essential objective has been attained, and
        none has been approached as nearly as in the two northern phases of the
        offensive. Concentration, not dispersal, of effort is the means to a
        quick decision. If Germany were not pressed for time and could be
        content with partial victories, she might be satisfied, but Germany is
        decidedly pressed for time, and only decisive actions now count.</p>

        <p>The Americans are coming into the battlefront, and will presently be
        there in force. This front now extends over 200 miles. The superiority
        of aggressive force given by the collapse of Russia and Rumania is
        ebbing away.</p>

        <h3><a id="FRENCH_OUTNUMBERED" name="FRENCH_OUTNUMBERED"></a>FRENCH
        OUTNUMBERED</h3>

        <p>The question will have arisen in some minds why, if the defenses of
        the Chemin des Dames were as strong as I had represented them to be,
        last Monday's attack should have so quickly overcome them. Detailed
        narratives are being accumulated which throw light on this subject. I
        take the case of the division holding the French left a week ago. We
        all remember its front, which was naturally and artificially of the
        strongest. It had nearly twelve hours' notice of what was afoot.</p>

        <p>In the first place, the German artillery preparation, though short,
        was of infernal violence. The rolling barrage was two miles deep. It
        destroyed the French telephone wires and filled the battery
        emplacements and machine-gun posts with various kinds of poison gas.
        Dust and artificial smoke clouds isolated groups of defenders and hid
        the waves of assault till they broke with a four-fold superiority of
        force. Many groups were thus surrounded, but fought on for a couple of
        hours, causing the enemy heavy losses. Many short counterattacks
        delayed advances and every line of trench wire was used.</p>

        <p>But the next most important thing, since reinforcements could not
        arrive immediately, was that the mass of the division should be held
        together and drawn back gradually for the defense of more essential
        positions. These lay beyond the Soissons bridgehead. Reinforced last
        Tuesday night, the division defended the plateau southeast of Soissons
        for four days with obstinate heroism.</p>

        <h3><a id="AIR_SUPREMACY_OF_ALLIES" name=
        "AIR_SUPREMACY_OF_ALLIES"></a>AIR SUPREMACY OF ALLIES</h3>

        <p>It may now be said that the allied airmen have established decided
        supremacy in the new battlefield. The Germans had a week ago, in this
        as in other respects, the advantage of their preparations and
        initiative, and they used it boldly, flying low in numbers, and
        machine-gunning our retreating ranks.</p>

        <p>The balance could not be instantly redressed. The airplane seems to
        be the very type of mobility, but it devours petrol, demands repairs,
        and, in brief, must carry its camp with it.</p>

        <p>Every day of this critical week has seen a larger concentration
        between the Oise and the Marne, and an increasing number of combats and
        expeditions. The first essential was to have constant information of
        the enemy's movements; and this scouting work, though less sensational
        than some other parts of the air program, remains perhaps the most
        important of all.</p>

        <p>Then followed with growing vigor the development of the aggressive
        functions of the air service in which it became a sort of extension of
        artillery and cavalry and even of infantry. A single group in one day
        brought down six boche planes and three sausages, dropped seventeen
        tons of bombs in the region of Rheims, and tons on marching columns of
        the enemy in the neighborhood of Ville-en-Tardenois.</p>

        <p>"Our pilots," said a group commander, "had orders not to come back
        with a single cartridge or bomb, and you may take it from me that they
        do not waste their munitions on clouds."</p>

        <p>On Thursday another group commander, receiving news that an enemy
        column was stretched over three miles of a certain road, sent about
        fifty machines to deal with it. They charged as a squadron of cavalry
        would do, coming down to within twenty and even ten yards of the earth,
        and with bombs and machine guns effectually dispersing and demoralizing
        the graycoats.</p>

        <p>Many enemy planes and sausage balloons have been brought down, but
        that is in the circumstances a secondary effort. Lines of communication
        and rear camps and centres of the enemy also have been harried. On
        Friday no less than seventy tons and on Saturday sixty-two tons of
        explosives were dropped by airmen on German bivouac troops.</p>

        <h3><a id="IN_THE_MARNE_VALLEY" name="IN_THE_MARNE_VALLEY"></a>IN THE
        MARNE VALLEY</h3>

        <p>I went down to the Marne Valley yesterday afternoon and from the
        edge of a wooded hill looked across over part of the north bank where
        the Germans are established. <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"
        name="Page_25">[Pg 25]</a></span>Established is hardly the word, for
        everything is floating and provisional in this phase of the war, and it
        is more than ever invisible except where infantry actions are in
        course, because there are no fixed intrenched lines. I could not find
        any trace of the enemy on the opposite amphitheatre of hills, but an
        observer hanging above at the tail of a sausage balloon may have seen
        something, for from time to time the French guns blazed angrily over my
        head and buildings were on fire in the villages.</p>

        <p>In this winding stretch of the valley crests rise 500 feet above the
        broad, strong stream, and there are five or six miles between the two
        ridges. The French have guns and machine guns in position, and any
        considerable attempt to cross will be very costly.</p>

        <p>Two hundred Germans came over yesterday morning and are now more or
        less contented guests of the French Republic. But the enemy does not
        seem to contemplate an immediate passage, if at all. It would probably
        be tried further west at some point where the northern hills are more
        dominant. The section of the important objectives appears to lie in
        this direction.</p>

        <p>Immediately behind the zone of mutual observation, all the humming
        activities of arms are proceeding with a freedom unknown in the days of
        trench warfare, partly because this is the nature of the war of
        movement and partly because, like other services, the air squadrons are
        dispersed and the German airmen cannot obtain more than local and
        momentary equality. And amid all the flow of troops and guns, the
        pitching of camps, the laying of field telegraphs, shifting of
        hospitals and hangars, bringing up of munitions and supplies, there is
        an air of calm over the whole scene that would astonish those who see
        the offensive only as it is concentrated in a newspaper sheet.</p>

        <h3><a id="FIERCE_FIGHTING_JUNE_3" name=
        "FIERCE_FIGHTING_JUNE_3"></a>FIERCE FIGHTING JUNE 3</h3>

        <p><i>In his dispatch dated June 4 Mr. Perris described the fighting on
        the 3d, which was the last desperate attempt of the Germans to advance
        in that phase. He wrote</i>:</p>

        <p>The battle blazed out afresh last night along and south of the upper
        Ourcq, and the struggle is raging with violence, due, in part, to the
        fact that both sides have brought up many guns and in part to the
        desperation of the Germans as once more they see victory slipping out
        of their hands.</p>

        <p>Tactically, the chief feature today is the attempt of the enemy to
        support the attack on the Ourcq by a thrust further south along its
        tributary, the Clignon, a small stream following a marshy valley
        westward to the middle course of the Ourcq. There the most bitter
        combats have taken place and continue about the villages of Bouresches,
        Torcy, and Veuilly-la-Poterie. At the latter point the Germans tried to
        get around to the southward, but were effectually stopped in the
        Veuilly Wood, a mile south of the village, by Americans. In all this
        fighting the enemy's losses have been very severe, for in every case we
        had the best defensive positions, well supported by machine guns and
        75s.</p>

        <p>I spoke yesterday of the importance of the French stand to the
        southwest of Soissons, both as limiting the enemy's access to the Aisne
        Valley and as narrowing his approach to the Ourcq Valley. A slight
        withdrawal to the line of the villages of Pernant, Saconin, Missy, and
        Vaucastille yesterday did not materially weaken this buttress of the
        front. Nor is it seriously weakened by another short withdrawal this
        morning between Pernant and Missy, for which the enemy has had to pay
        dearly. We still hold Tresnes and Faverolles, and the prospects of von
        Boehm reaching Villers-Cotterets are not bright enough to cheer the
        drooping spirits of Berlin.</p>

        <h3><a id="AMERICANS_AT_WORK" name="AMERICANS_AT_WORK"></a>AMERICANS AT
        WORK</h3>

        <p>Another small warning of the rising power of American arms was given
        on the Marne yesterday morning, when a fresh band of machine gunners
        helped a French regiment to break an attempt to cross the river.</p>

        <p>Between the Oise and the Aisne homeric conflicts are reported from
        the neighborhood of Carlepont Wood, in which the hill called Mont de
        Choisy, after having been lost and recaptured five times, remains in
        French hands.</p>

        <p>In all fields, therefore, the equalization of forces produces a
        result more and more favorable. The defense of Mont de Choisy is the
        work of French colonials. These troops had already distinguished
        themselves, particularly at Douaumont, before Verdun.</p>

        <p>Though the pressure upon the Franco-British line from Verneuil, on
        the Marne, to Rheims, has been much less severe than that on the
        western flank of the offensive, it is to be noted that the enemy has
        some of his best divisions in the former area.</p>

        <p>French cavalry corps, generally dismounted, but sometimes playing
        their old part, have rendered excellent service during the battle. One
        of them after forming an essential element in the retreating line, had
        to meet Saturday and Sunday repeated attacks conducted by four—perhaps
        five—German divisions in the Malmaison and Trotte Woods, which crown
        the hills northeast of Verneuil, forming the buttress of the allied
        positions beyond the Marne. In the Ourcq Valley toward La Fierté-Milon
        another body of dismounted cavalry had to stand against some of the
        best Prussian troops, including the first division of the Guards.</p>

        <h3><a id="ENEMYS_LONG_PAUSE" name="ENEMYS_LONG_PAUSE"></a>ENEMY'S LONG
        PAUSE</h3>

        <p><i>In his dispatch dated June 5 Mr. Perris noted that a marked pause
        had fallen on the battlefield. His comment was this</i>:</p>

        <p>The pause in the enemy's adventure is a sign of weakness on his part
        and of advantage to us. Germany is fighting against<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_26" name="Page_26">[Pg 26]</a></span> time. The
        superiority she gained from the east is passing. The power of surprise
        has been her greatest asset. After that everything depends for her on
        speed in the exploitation of her success, and every delay is loss.</p>

        <p>The next thing to remark is the great skill with which General Foch
        has pursued what may be called his provisional Fabian strategy. With
        surprise and superior reserves in the hands of the enemy, he had to
        face a situation of extreme difficulty. To weaken other parts of the
        front prematurely in order to defend the Aisne would have invited a
        fresh blow in those other parts.</p>

        <p>Two needs rose supreme—that of economizing men so as to hasten the
        day when the Allies should have the superiority of forces necessary to
        victory, and that of barring the road of the enemy toward every vital
        objective. These objects have been attained, and if it should turn out
        that the third act of the offensive is finished, this will mean that,
        with all the unquestionable ability and daring of the German General
        Staff, Foch has beaten them for the third time in the two and a half
        months of their maximum power.</p>

        <p>In any case, nothing of first-class importance has been lost. The
        allied front has not been broken. The roads to Paris, toward which the
        offensive was turned on the third day, are blocked. The ruins of Rheims
        are nearly indefensible, but the road to Châlons is barred. The
        plateaus between the Oise and the Aisne and between the Aisne and the
        Ourcq stand like bastions of a vast fortress. Château-Thierry is lost,
        and the eastern railway and the high road are locally interrupted, but
        the Marne and the Paris road beside it are covered.</p>

        <p>Finally, the enemy has engaged fifty divisions of his reserves in
        this battle, and many of them have suffered very heavily.</p>

        <h3><a id="AT_CHATEAU-THIERRY" name="AT_CHATEAU-THIERRY"></a>AT
        CHATEAU-THIERRY</h3>

        <p>The attempt of part of the German 36th Division to cross the Marne
        at Jaulgonne was frustrated brilliantly by the Americans and French. It
        appears that a few men succeeded in getting across the river Thursday
        night [May 30] at this point, eight miles east of Château-Thierry,
        where the Marne makes a loop by the north.</p>

        <p>They took shelter in the cutting and tunnel of the Paris-Châlons
        railway, which runs along the south bank, and though they lost
        seriously and their pontoons were destroyed, they got reinforcements
        over to the strength of a battalion.</p>

        <p>An attack to clear them out was, therefore, organized, and this took
        place Sunday night, [June 2.] By that time the Germans had put
        twenty-two light bridges across the stream, of which four had been
        smashed by the French artillery, and had established a bridgehead with
        six machine guns and a hundred men in the railway station on the south
        bank opposite Jaulgonne.</p>

        <p>This post was frontally attacked by a section of dismounted cavalry
        who, however, were held up by machine-gun fire until American machine
        guns came into action. Two sections of French infantry simultaneously
        fell upon the bridgehead and the Germans broke before them.</p>

        <p>The prisoners, of whom there are a hundred, declare that their
        officers abandoned them at the beginning of the attack. A few men
        escaped by swimming, and thirty or forty others gained the northern
        bank by the pontoon boats. The rest of the battalion was wiped out.</p>

        <p>The German losses in the action at the bridge of Château-Thierry
        were severe. It is estimated that a thousand bodies lay by and near the
        bridge, and the American machine gunners fired tens of thousands of
        cartridges.</p>

        <h3><a id="HOW_THE_BATTLE_BEGAN" name="HOW_THE_BATTLE_BEGAN"></a>HOW
        THE BATTLE BEGAN</h3>

        <p><i>In his dispatches on June 2 and June 5 Mr. Perris gave these
        further details of how the battle began</i>:</p>

        <p>As further details which I have received of their part in the
        beginning of the battle clearly show, these divisions, the 50th, 8th,
        21st, and 25th, were, it will be remembered, tired from bitter and
        repeated actions in the course of the northern offensive. They had been
        on the front only seventeen days when last Monday's attack was made,
        and therefore had hardly had time to become thoroughly acquainted with
        the sector. The main force of the enemy assault fell on the front of
        the 50th and 8th Divisions, against whom there were four German
        divisions in line and two more in immediate reserve. The odds against
        the British on this day were two and a half to one.</p>

        <p>The 50th Division on the left was doing well on the Craonne Plateau,
        when in the course of the morning they suddenly found that the enemy
        was behind them. Owing to this surprise, the neighboring brigade of the
        50th Division suffered badly.</p>

        <p>By afternoon General Fritz von Below's men had got to the line of
        the river, and in the evening the British were back at Guyencourt. By
        Wednesday evening they held a large crescent around Fismes from
        Lopeigne on the west through Coulanges and Lagery back to the Vesle at
        Muizon. By this time the fighting strength of the British units was
        greatly reduced, but reinforcements were coming up and the worst of the
        crisis was over. The full story of the splendid episode can hardly yet
        be told, but some day it will shine among the greatest achievements of
        the war.</p>

        <p>Some time must yet elapse ere we can know fully and exactly what
        occurred on the Chemin des Dames at and after 4 A. M. on May 27. Many
        of the combatants have died a martyr's death and been buried
        by<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27" name="Page_27">[Pg
        27]</a></span> alien hands where they fell. Many more will long
        languish in prisoners' camps; but the remnants of some regiments have
        now come down from the front to rest, and by piecing together the
        narratives of these weary men it is possible to make the first outline
        of the story that will one day be told in all its pitifulness and
        terror.</p>

        <p>One of them is the French infantry regiment which had long held the
        central sector of this front. For this last trial it had been prepared
        by months of trench raiding and strengthening its defenses. Submerged
        by a storm of fire and poison gas and by wave upon wave of assault, it
        went down in a single morning, fighting the hopeless fight to the
        bitter end. A small number lived to cross the Aisne in the afternoon,
        and these had to continue the struggle for four days and nights,
        practically without respite. Few are those, even in this war, who have
        survived such agony.</p>

        <p>They were warned, and, so far as their local means allowed, were
        prepared for the attack. Gas masks, machine guns, grenade
        stores—everything was ready. The order was to hold ground between the
        second and third positions or to die in the effort, and it was carried
        out. It was to be expected that the telephone wires would be cut. There
        remained carrier pigeons. A rolling barrage two miles deep and of
        indescribable violence extinguished the poor efforts of the local
        batteries to reply. Thick clouds of artificial smoke, gas, and dust
        shrouded the assault, so that rocket signals were not seen at the rear
        and the enemy was invisible till he reached the parapets.</p>

        <p>The line was almost immediately broken and the battle became a
        struggle of isolated groups, heavily outnumbered without the
        possibility of reinforcement, defending scraps of broken trench dugouts
        or quarries and still resisting long after the main tide of the
        conflict had passed south.</p>

        <p>A copy lies before me of messages dated from 3:30 to 8:30 A. M. and
        sent back from these isolated groups by pigeon. No words could be so
        eloquent as their laconic brevity. When permission to retreat was given
        some officers refused to avail themselves of it.</p>

        <p>The Colonel, with his staff papers, crossed the Aisne at 10 A. M.
        and organized the defense of the passage. The survivors of the regiment
        were re-formed on the south bank, and on the following day received a
        reinforcement of men, bringing it up to a quarter of its original
        strength. This handful had to meet the heavy attack southwest of
        Soissons on May 29, and a series of attacks on the following two days.
        No more was humanly possible, and they were withdrawn. They say that
        not a man had uttered a complaint.</p>

        <h3><a id="BATTLE_OF_THE_OISE_1" name="BATTLE_OF_THE_OISE_1"></a>BATTLE
        OF THE OISE</h3>

        <p><i>A fourth phase of the German offensive opened June 9 on a front
        of 20 miles between Noyon and Montdidier, which Mr. Perris describes
        thus</i>:</p>

        <p>A new phase of the German offensive opened this morning at 4:30
        o'clock on a front of about twenty miles, extending from Montdidier to
        Noyon. The artillery preparation, which again was rich in gas shells,
        began at midnight, and covered not only the front, but a deep zone
        behind it, especially villages and roads where the enemy thought to
        catch the French local reserves.</p>

        <p>There were evident reasons for the choice of this sector, and in
        particular for seeking control of part of it, for a successful push
        south along the line of the Roye-Compiègne railway would add another
        converging road to the four roads leading toward Paris by the Oise,
        Aisne, Ourcq, and Marne Valleys, which had already been tried. On the
        other hand, the enemy could not reasonably hope for any such surprise
        as was obtained in the first act of the offensive before St. Quentin
        and in the third act of that on the Chemin des Dames.</p>

        <p>In general, the French are resisting with dogged courage in their
        covering positions, which are beyond range of the enemy mine throwers.
        Evidence accumulates of the heaviness of the German losses in the
        recent fighting and of the disappearance of the shallow enthusiasm with
        which the offensive was begun.</p>

        <p><i>In describing the progress of this assault Mr. Ferris wrote on
        June 10</i>:</p>

        <p>The front of the attack was twenty miles in length, as compared with
        a front of thirty miles in the attack on the Chemin des Dames and fifty
        miles in the first phase of the offensive on March 21, and so far it is
        only on the central half of this smaller front that any considerable
        impression has been made on the French lines.</p>

        <p>Whatever may have been the exact design, there had not been this
        time the same extreme scruple to conceal troop movements, and for some
        days past the exceptional traffic of convoys, the suspicious activity
        of the enemy batteries in the correction of ranges and other signs had
        given warning of what was afoot.</p>

        <h3><a id="HEAVIER_GERMAN_LOSSES" name=
        "HEAVIER_GERMAN_LOSSES"></a>HEAVIER GERMAN LOSSES</h3>

        <p>One consequence was that, when the German infantry advanced
        yesterday morning, it had to meet a volume of fire very different from
        that which had answered the surprises of St. Quentin and the Aisne
        Heights. French gunners had thoroughly studied the ground before them
        and were all ready to deluge every path of approach directly that
        graycoat waves appeared. From the beginning, therefore, the German
        losses have been heavier than on the earlier occasions, and this must
        affect the development of the action.</p>

        <p>In other respects the now familiar von Hutier manoeuvre appears to
        have been repeated, shock battalions carrying light<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_28" name="Page_28">[Pg 28]</a></span> machine
        guns and machine rifles concentrating upon local breaches in our line
        and leaving the task of cleaning up islands of resistance to the
        support troops while they pressed on rapidly to exploit the first
        success. It will probably be found that the operation was begun with
        about fifteen divisions in the line, approximately 150,000 men, giving
        a density of one division to a mile and a third.</p>

        <p>Faced with a force superior in all arms, long resistance of the
        first line is impossible, but it is significant that at 8 o'clock
        yesterday morning, that is after four hours of a terrible storm of gas
        and explosive shells, followed by four hours of hand-to-hand struggle,
        our allies were still in a large part of the field fighting within what
        is called the zone of advanced posts, and only the centre had fallen
        back on the zone of principal resistance. Plemont Hill, overlooking
        Lassigny, was still holding out at that hour, although the front had
        lain immediately beneath it. The villages of Le Fretoy and Courcelles
        were lost during the morning, but were recovered by counterattacks, in
        which the French troops showed the highest spirit.</p>

        <p>Up to late last night the only result that von Hutier could regard
        as in any degree justifying the effort made and the losses suffered was
        the capture of the villages of Ressons-sur-Matz and Mareuil-la-Motte,
        whereas on the French left before Ribecourt, by Le Tretoy to
        Courcelles, and on the right from Belval to Cannectancourt, the advance
        varied from one to two miles. At the centre it rather exceeded
        three.</p>

        <p>This is a poor gain, judged by precedent, and was bought at an
        exorbitant price, but it has a certain tactical and perhaps superior
        consequence.</p>

        <p><i>Later on June 10 Mr. Perris gave this further description of the
        progress of the fighting</i>:</p>

        <p>"This is the real battle," said a French staff officer, meaning to
        contrast today's fierce fighting between forces unequal indeed, but not
        crushingly so, with the attack on the Chemin des Dames. Here the French
        had a stronger line, their reserves were nearer, and they had
        sufficient notice to bring their batteries at every point into
        effective action. Effective, do I say? At many points it was a massacre
        of the columns of assault, and there is unanimity as well among the
        prisoners as among our own combatants that the ranks of the enemy have
        been torn and plowed with shot and shell. Never, perhaps, has the
        German Army paid so dearly for an advance which nowhere exceeds five
        miles.</p>

        <p>This is the essential fact which governs all that follows; for if,
        as the German official press says with a measure of truth, the German
        objective is not a city or a port, but the complete destruction of the
        allied armies, so our objective is not to hold a certain geographical
        area, but to punish the advance so that the enemy forces will be
        exhausted, while ours are being constantly recruited from oversea for
        the last stroke that will give us the victory.</p>

        <p>The smallness of the enemy's gains in this fourth phase of the grand
        battle is merely the sign that von Hutier found across his path an
        adversary prepared as far as was humanly possible, determined and able
        to contest every yard of ground.</p>

        <p>Thus the village of Courcelles, only two miles from the old front,
        was lost, retaken, lost again, recovered, and remains in the hands of
        the French. Thus Plemont, a position insignificant as compared with the
        Aisne Heights, although encircled and covered with fire, was being
        defended till last evening. Since then no carrier pigeon has come in,
        and it must be presumed that the heroic handful of men who held this
        point of the front have been overcome. Their countrymen will not forget
        them.</p>

        Battle</h2>

        <p>By WALTER DURANTY</p>

        <p>[Copyrighted]</p>

        <p><i>The turning point of the great battle came on June 11, when the
        French delivered a desperate counterblow south of Montdidier and drove
        the Germans back from the Aronde River, regaining important ground
        along a front of seven and one-half miles, and capturing 1,000
        prisoners and many heavy guns. This phase of the struggle is described
        by Walter Duranty, another special correspondent, whose dispatch is
        copyrighted for</i> <span class="smcap">Current History
        Magazine</span>. <i>It is dated June 11, 1918.</i></p>

        <p>As the battle continues it seems that the second week of June will
        rank as one of the bloodiest and most decisive periods in the world's
        history.</p>

        <p>It is the veritable climax of four years of struggle. In the last
        twenty-four hours the violence of the fighting has increased still
        further. The limit of human endurance has been forced yet another notch
        higher. Along a front of nearly twenty miles the Germans are driving
        more than a quarter of a million men forward through a sea of blood.
        The defenders say that it is as though the whole of the German Army is
        engaged against them; no sooner is one battalion annihilated than
        another takes its place, and another and another.</p>

        <p>Early yesterday morning a handful of dismounted<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_29" name="Page_29">[Pg 29]</a></span> cavalry,
        greatly employed for liaison work, fought their way back to the French
        lines from the surrounded hill of Plemont. They reported that the
        survivors of the French battalion occupying the position were still
        holding out when they left, and that no less than fourteen attacks had
        already been repulsed.</p>

        <h3><a id="CARPETED_WITH_DEAD" name="CARPETED_WITH_DEAD"></a>CARPETED
        WITH DEAD</h3>

        <p>The grassy slopes of the hill bore a hideous carpet of thousands of
        German dead, over which new forces still advanced with the same madness
        of sacrifice as the Carthaginians of old, flinging their children,
        their possessions, and themselves into Moloch's furnace. The bloody
        religion of militarism that Germany has followed for forty years has
        led its votaries to culminating orgies of destruction.</p>

        <p>But the defenders are not appalled by the fury of the struggle, nor
        by numbers. Each position is held until every foot of ground has been
        paid for by German blood. Again and again a swift counterattack,
        delivered at the right moment, has wrested from the assailant the
        fruits of the success he won so dearly and forced him to pay a toll of
        lives twice over. In the villages thus retaken, the poilus say,
        gray-clad corpses lay heaped up as though they had been collected for a
        gigantic funeral pyre, and more than once the advancing enemy was
        screened from the defenders' fire by a rampart of his own dead.</p>

        <p>The general situation of the battle has changed little. In the
        centre the French have retired slightly. On the left also there is a
        southward bulge in the line. The right is still held by a wooded massif
        above Drelincourt. On the right the towers of Noyon Cathedral could
        just be distinguished. To the left smoke haze marked Lassigny, half
        hidden in a hollow. It was a natural fortress with an infinity of cover
        for guns, men, and machine guns against which no fury of sacrifice
        might prevail. Well may the Germans try to turn that grim salient by an
        advance further south in the centre—clearly their immediate objective.
        They held it once before last year's retreat and they know its
        strength.</p>

        <p>As I returned from the observation post I passed through a great
        natural amphitheatre in a sort of mountain. At one side the Germans had
        carved a huge eagle, colored blood red, on a slab of rock above a
        grotto that had been their headquarters. Beneath it in Gothic letters
        was the Brandenburg motto, "On, Brandenburg, on!" The artist who
        designed the bird that is the symbol of German violence was well
        inspired. The Kaiser's eagles are red, indeed, clotted and stained from
        beak to claw with the crimson of countless slaughters.</p>

        <p>The latest information from the battlefront emphasizes still more
        clearly the difference between the results of the new German method of
        attack when applied on a weakly held sector and a front where the
        allied strength is normal. On two previous occasions Hindenburg's storm
        divisions gained sensational success right from the outset by literally
        swamping small forces by sheer weight after the defenders had been
        half-stunned by the terrific bombardment to which their inferiority of
        artillery permitted no adequate response.</p>

        <p>Conditions are very different today. In the first place there was no
        strategic surprise—the German move in this sector had been foreseen.
        The utmost vigilance was everywhere maintained, and unmistakable signs,
        such as the movement of troops, convoys, and artillery registration,
        had been carefully noted. Precautions to meet the shock had been taken.
        Against attack in depth by successive waves a depth defense had been
        planned, with a front line of thinly held outposts to minimize loss,
        and successive lines of greater strength extending back for
        kilometers.</p>

        <p>When the German artillery storm broke out it was answered by a
        perfect hurricane of French fire. Not only was every possible point
        where the enemy troops might advance or batteries be hidden thoroughly
        registered, but artillery held in reserve had its guns trained on
        targets offered further in the rear by each hill, wood, or valley that
        the enemy might assail as a vantage point or medium for
        infiltration.</p>

        <p>The consequence has been that, in direct contradiction to the former
        drives, the enemy's initial losses have been enormous and his gains
        small; and the French losses were greatly decreased. Above all, there
        has been no penetration of the line of resistance. In places it bulged
        slightly under pressure, but only at the price of the most dogged
        fighting and heavy sacrifice, and withal very slowly. One fact marks
        the difference sufficiently:</p>

        <h3><a id="HOW_THEY_WERE_CHECKED" name="HOW_THEY_WERE_CHECKED"></a>HOW
        THEY WERE CHECKED</h3>

        <p>On May 27 the Germans had reached the Aisne—seven kilometers from
        the starting point, across difficult country—in four and one-half hours
        after the attack. In the first thirty hours of the present attack they
        had barely passed thinly held outposts. Along the whole
        thirty-kilometer front, from the Oise to Assainvillers—somewhat shorter
        than the area of bombardment—fifteen to twenty assaulting divisions
        were met by a galling machine-gun barrage and the terrible "75" fire
        curtain from quick-firers and batteries. Irreplaceable storm troops,
        whose training had taken months and whose existence was essential to
        the continuance of Hindenburg's new strategy, melted like snow beneath
        the August sun.</p>

        <p>At Plemont—the scene of one of the most gallant actions in the
        checking of the March drive by the men of the same army—the Germans met
        a stubborn resistance, though their dead lay there thick as fresh-cut
        wheat but a few hundred yards beyond the line<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_30" name="Page_30">[Pg 30]</a></span> of
        outposts. Even in the centre, where the enemy's progress was deepest,
        an unbroken line of defense was constituted by the same troops that had
        withstood the attack from the beginning. Their spirit and numbers were
        still sufficient, though the Germans opposing them had sent forward
        fresh storm troops in wave after wave.</p>

        Description of the French Counterblow</h2>

        <p><i>The French counterblow described above by Mr. Duranty was of
        great importance in changing the entire aspect of affairs for the
        Allies. Mr. Perris, in a dispatch dated June 12, gave these further
        particulars</i>:</p>

        <p>Faces that wore a serious expression yesterday morning are decidedly
        cheerful today. The battle has, in fact, taken a better turn. It is a
        very dreadful struggle; no Frenchman can forget that fact, and in the
        fever of weighing and measuring results more distant observers should
        not for a moment overlook what they mean in flesh and blood. That being
        said, we may join in the satisfaction of our allies that on its third
        day the German onset has suffered a distinct check.</p>

        <p>Following the front from west to east, the first thing to note is
        the series of French counterattacks on the left, carried to a
        considerable measure of success by skill in the direction and high
        spirit and fortitude in the ranks.</p>

        <p>At 11 A. M. yesterday a movement began from a little east of the
        railway line between Domfront and Wacquemoulin. The infantry were
        supported by tanks, and along the whole line the Germans were swept
        back. A French contingent actually reached points which were within the
        German front. The French advance went well beyond Rubescourt and Le
        Fretoy, half way between Courcelles and Mortemer, and between Mery and
        Couvilly, beyond Belloy, and to the border of St. Maur.</p>

        <p>Meanwhile the enemy had delivered a very powerful blow at the French
        centre and had driven a way, despite vigorous opposition, as far as the
        village of Antheuil, two miles south of the Matz. At 4 P. M. a further
        counterattack was therefore made from the French left centre, and the
        enemy advance was completely arrested. In these combats a certain
        amount of confusion was apparent in the German ranks, and the fact that
        1,000 prisoners and some cannon were taken speaks eloquently. This was
        not the heaviest punishment. Eyewitnesses say that German corpses strew
        the battlefield in piles.</p>

        <p>Three critical days of the offensive have then given the enemy at
        the cost of enormous losses a not very magnificent result. We now know
        that the program was to reach Compiègne on the second day. General von
        Hutier must be greatly disappointed.</p>

        <p>The attack was begun with fourteen divisions, at full strength, in
        the line. They included at the centre divisions of the Prussian Guard
        and four other crack divisions. About twice as many divisions have now
        been thrown into this battle, ten already holding the sector and the
        rest being fresh reserves.</p>

        <p>These figures may be measured by the fact that the total German
        forces in the west amount to 207 divisions, and that of these before
        the offensive only sixty-two were in the general reserve, the rest
        being engaged on the front. The more we consider in the light of
        material considerations like these what the German command essayed and
        what it has accomplished the more we shall appreciate the valor of the
        French armies and the qualities of their chiefs; and it is impossible
        to do justice to either without such reflection.</p>

        <h3><a id="FRENCH_HOLD_GAINS" name="FRENCH_HOLD_GAINS"></a>FRENCH HOLD
        GAINS</h3>

        <p><i>On June 12 Mr. Perris reported that the French were holding their
        gains and gave these further details of the counterattack the day
        before</i>:</p>

        <p>The French lines hold all the way round from the important position
        of Mery Plateau by the hamlets of St. Maur and Antheuil to Marest and
        Chevincourt. Time after time, last night and this morning, the
        gray-coated masses of General von Hutier came on, only to be mowed down
        by waves of fire from the 75s and machine guns, and their remnants
        dispersed with bayonet and grenade.</p>

        <p>Yesterday's French counterattacks met great bodies of the enemy
        prepared to force another advance. Four divisions were found to be
        ranged in a space of two miles. Hence the frightful intensity of the
        combat and the abnormal slaughter.</p>

        <p>The French tanks did very good service, and fleets of airplanes,
        British as well as French, swept down upon the battlefield before and
        behind our infantry, dropping bombs and raining down volleys of bullets
        wherever a group of enemy soldiers was seen. The numerical inferiority
        of the French was thus made good.</p>

        <p>The block of wooded hills was very difficult to defend, even if the
        enemy had got no further than Mareuil. The woods prevented long views
        and open fields of fire; the deep ravines invited infiltrations; the
        Oise Valley at the back left supply and relief columns open to the
        German guns, and the Matz Valley, on the west, was the plain path of
        envelopment. These are the reasons why this corner was not held
        longer.</p>

        <p>Among the wheat and beet fields of the gently rolling plateau
        further west, on the other hand, the defense had more advantage. There
        are folds of ground enough to hide its batteries and reserves, but in
        every direction there are open lines of fire, room for manoeuvre and
        nume rous railroads. Striking northeast from the Estrées Railway, the
        French threaten the German centre.</p>

        <p>To continue the southward march, even if it were possible, before
        this pressure on the west had been disposed of would be reckless.
        Hutier has met his match.</p>

        <h3><a id="THE_COMPIEGNE_THRUST" name="THE_COMPIEGNE_THRUST"></a>THE
        COMPIEGNE THRUST</h3>

        <p><i>On June 13 General von Hutier made a threatening thrust toward
        Compiègne, which was parried by the French and was practically the
        termination of further serious efforts in this phase by the Germans.
        Mr. Perris tells the story of it as follows</i>:</p>

        <p>South of the Aisne the high, bare farmlands extending from Soissons
        to the borders of the forest of Compiègne are cut by a valley running
        up from the other great forest of Villers-Cotterets to the river at
        Ambleny. This valley, with the villages of Laversine, Coeuvre, Cutry,
        Dommiers, and St. Pierre-Aigle, has constituted the front for the last
        fortnight, with French outposts on the east side, but the real line of
        resistance on the west.</p>

        <p>Von Hutier having met with trouble beyond his expectations on the
        west of the Oise, his colleague, von Boehm, was sent yesterday morning
        to create a diversion on this flank of the battlefield. Five divisions,
        two of them fresh ones, were thrown forward on both sides of Laversine,
        a front of four miles.</p>

        <p>Though outnumbered, the French have given a fine account of
        themselves, breaking repeated assaults of the enemy, who is reported to
        have got into the villages of Coeuvre and St. Pierre, a feat more than
        counterbalanced by the French advance at Damard, further south on the
        border of Villers-Cotterets Forest, and the admirable action of the
        Americans on the ground recently taken by them in Clignon Valley.</p>

        <p>This, however, is not the best sign for the fifth day of the
        offensive. Von Hutier's thrust from the north toward Compiègne was by
        far the most threatening of the numerous lines of attack the German
        command has now opened. It has been brought to a stop by reactions of
        the French left and centre, and was this morning contained, as we may
        hope definitely, from the Mery Plateau and along the course of the
        Matz.</p>

        <h3><a id="ENEMYS_FEVERISH_HASTE" name=
        "ENEMYS_FEVERISH_HASTE"></a>ENEMY'S FEVERISH HASTE</h3>

        <p>The feverish haste with which the enemy's attacks are multiplied as
        the field of the offensive is enlarged, speaks eloquently of the
        conscious need to bring the grand adventure to a speedy climax. But
        this haste involves heavy moral as well as numerical usury. Instead of
        a full normal period for refilling and new equipment, including rest at
        the rear, or in a quiet sector, and a course of fresh training being
        given to a division withdrawn from the line owing to its losses, it is
        hurriedly reconstituted and pushed back into the battlefront after as
        few days as possible.</p>

        <p>Up to now the German armies have been sustained, not only by
        reinforcements from Russia, but by the long rest of the Winter months;
        otherwise they could not have accomplished what they have done. These
        sources of strength are being rapidly exhausted. The human
        material—cannon food—is failing in quality. The field depots have been
        emptied of recruits. Men from the depots in Germany are rushed to the
        front. Cavalry officers are dismounted to fill gaps in the infantry.
        Men detached for special work are called back to their units, and still
        the war god is unsatisfied.</p>

        <p>Incorporation of the 1920 class began in April and May. Miners and
        mechanics are again turned into the fighting ranks, ill as they can be
        spared from industry. It is probable that not a division has been left
        in the east that would be fit for the western front. Wounded men and
        invalids imperfectly cured are pressed back into service. And behind
        the armies thus replenished there is the nation, hungry, enfeebled,
        terrorized, uttering words of despair even in its letters to the front.
        Ludendorff may well hurry!</p>

        <h3><a id="DEFENSE_OF_COURCELLES" name=
        "DEFENSE_OF_COURCELLES"></a>DEFENSE OF COURCELLES</h3>

        <p>A very brief diary of the battle at a single point will give an idea
        of its bitter violence. The small village of Courcelles lies across the
        chief road of the western wing of the offensive, only about two miles
        from its starting point with the Montdidier-Estrées railway, and the
        same distance behind it. For these reasons, and because it stands on a
        spur of the Mery Plateau, it was certain to be a hardly contested
        position.</p>

        <p>On Sunday morning, June 9, taking advantage of the cover afforded by
        broad fields of well-grown wheat, the Germans came up the slope from
        Rollot and rushed the village. At 9:40 the French re-formed and retook
        it, capturing 200 men and four officers. Forty minutes later a new wave
        was brought up from the north, but was thrown back. Some storm troops,
        however, got around by the rear. These were in turn repulsed.</p>

        <p>Several hours passed in which the three streets of broken houses
        were put in order for a siege. At 3 P. M. a fresh attack was repulsed.
        Later in the afternoon the German success at Mery and Belloy resulted
        in Courcelles being beset on three sides, only a narrow alley of
        communication to the west remaining open.</p>

        <p>The defenders now had their blood up. The reserves would soon
        arrive. This western flank of the battle was of the utmost importance.
        It had become a point of honor that the village should not be lost.</p>

        <p>At 4:40 A. M. on Monday, after a preparatory bombardment, the next
        blow fell. In ten minutes its failure was evident, though <span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_32" name="Page_32">[Pg 32]</a></span>the fighting
        about the barbed wire continued for an hour. Three more assaults
        followed in the afternoon and evening. In the last of these some
        Germans got into the village, but they were at last driven out. On
        Tuesday the heroes of this splendid defense reaped the only reward they
        desired. The great French counterattack definitely freed their little
        fortress.</p>

        <h3><a id="TABLES_TURNED" name="TABLES_TURNED"></a>TABLES TURNED</h3>

        <p>This time it was the turn of the French to win the benefits of
        initiative and surprise. Only a quarter of an hour was given to the
        French artillery for its preparation work. Tanks and infantry then went
        forward in alternate lines. An officer describes the advance of the
        tanks rolling over the green wheatfields, while shells burst around
        them, as having the appearance of a battle at sea.</p>

        <p>The allied airmen, swooping above the moving line, not only sowed
        death in the enemy's ranks with their machine guns, but also raced
        forward and dropped bombs with effect on heavy batteries in the rear,
        killing their crews and putting the guns out of action.</p>

        <p>In some enemy units during this battle the men fought well. In
        others there have been unmistakable signs of demoralization. Such
        inequalities are not surprising in this crisis. The total superiority
        of force which a few months ago was enough to have terrified us, and
        which is still sufficiently serious to require every effort that can be
        put forth, is ebbing away.</p>

        Expert Views</h2>

        <p><i>All correspondents on June 14 united in the conclusion that the
        counterblows of the Allies and the brilliant reaction of the French
        from Courcelles to Mery ended the fourth phase of the great German
        offensive. Mr. Perris summed up the situation as follows on June
        14</i>:</p>

        <p>The front has subsided into actions of no more than local
        importance. The five days' battle west of the Oise has ended for the
        Germans, after an advance varying from two to six miles, in a very
        costly reverse, and for the Allies in a brilliant success of good
        generalship and indomitable spirit in the ranks.</p>

        <p>Beside the losses of the enemy, the French loss of the Thiescourt
        hills and the wooded part of the valley opposite is of little
        importance. The offensive which was to give a decision against them is
        far from finished, but in relation to the resistance it encounters it
        shows a falling, not a rising, gamut of power.</p>

        <p>The first push toward Amiens ended in ten days, having entailed upon
        the Allies the sacrifice of a tract forty miles deep and serious
        casualties. The following attack in the north lasted about as long, but
        with much slighter gains. The German success on the Chemin des Dames
        brought the Crown Prince's vanguard to the Marne, twenty-five miles
        from its starting point, but that it touched much less vital ground is
        proved by the transfer of its centre of pressure to the Ourcq Valley
        near Villers-Cotterets.</p>

        <p>From these results to those of the present week's fighting there is
        a marked descent, and this failure occurs in what must be accounted one
        of the most critical directions the enemy can pursue. The ambitious
        character of his design is now clear. It is not merely to divide the
        British from the French army and then destroy one of them, but also by
        a single series of converging operations to destroy them both.</p>

        <p>His approach to Amiens as the centre of their joint communications
        and to Hazebrouck as the door to the Channel ports has been followed by
        an approach along four converging lines to the region of Paris, the
        centre of French administrative life. In fact, the attainment of all
        these objectives would not end the war, for I am sure there is in
        France, and there probably is in the other countries concerned, a
        deadly resolution that it shall not be ended in any such way; that, if
        Paris should be destroyed—which heaven forfend—another capital shall be
        found, and that there shall be no surrender while there is an army on
        its legs.</p>

        <p>This offensive has had two aims—to reach the crescent north and east
        of Paris, whence a general attack could be launched, and to draw down,
        disperse, and harry the allied reserves preparatory to the final
        "Kaiserschlacht," the crowning blow along the whole line. Its relative
        failure is a great encouragement.</p>

        <h3><a id="PETAINS_MASTERLY_TACTICS" name=
        "PETAINS_MASTERLY_TACTICS"></a>PETAIN'S MASTERLY TACTICS</h3>

        <p><i>Walter Duranty, in reviewing the fourth phase of the offensive,
        sent the following cable dispatch to</i> <span class="smcap">The New
        York Times</span> <i>on June 13</i>:</p>

        <p>It has been said that the secret of Pétain's rise in three years
        from the position of Colonel to Commander in Chief of the French armies
        is his knowledge of when to launch counterattacks. The ability to
        select the right place and time for a sudden stroke which nullifies the
        enemy's gains has been the attribute of great captains throughout
        history, and is one of the cardinal bases of successful strategy. In
        that one word, counterattacks, lies the explanation of the triumphant
        French resistance in the present battle against vastly superior
        numbers—that and the indomitable courage of the defenders.</p>

        <p>The master tactician commanding the army whose sector has been
        assailed has so imbued his subordinates with his own
        principles<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_33" name="Page_33">[Pg
        33]</a></span> that there is hardly a position in the whole range of
        operations that the Germans have not been forced to take two or three
        times over. For it is not only the counter-stroke on a grand scale,
        like that which has won back nearly all the Germans' gains on the left
        wing, which counts in a struggle of this kind, where the losses
        inflicted on the enemy are far more important than a hill or a village
        saved or abandoned. It is the unexpected change from defense to attack,
        at the psychological moment, that has maintained the spirit of the
        French troops and smashed their weakened assailants just as they were
        thinking their success was assured.</p>

        <p>As the situation stands today [June 13] the Allies have won a great
        victory in one of the hardest fought battles of the war, and a
        carefully planned move in Hindenburg's desperate struggle against time
        has been met and nullified. The Germans have also learned to their cost
        that the American troops are already to be counted with. The enemy,
        whose morale is daily weakening under the strain of non-successes and
        never-ending calls upon his strength, has received a bitter reminder of
        the American menace, which more than any other factor is responsible
        for his convulsive striving after a speedy decision.</p>

        <p>[M. Tardieu, in a cablegram June 18 to the French High Commission at
        Washington, stated that 80,000 Germans had been put out of action in
        the Noyon-Montdidier offensive, and that General von Hutier had failed
        completely to realize his objective—the capture of Compiègne.]</p>

        <p class="center">[<span class="smcap">See Map of Italian Front, Page
        15</span>]</p>

        <p style="font-style: italic">An offensive was launched June 15, 1918,
        by the Austrians against the Italians with an army estimated to number
        1,000,000 men. The attack was on a front from the Asiago Plateau to the
        sea, a distance of ninety-seven miles. The course of the struggle in
        the first four days indicated the failure of the drive. The details of
        the earlier stages of the battle are given herewith.</p>

        <p>According to statements of prisoners, the Austrian objectives on the
        first day of the attack were Bassano, eight miles down the Brenta, and
        Treviso, eight miles west of the Piave. The attack along the Piave from
        the Venetian lagoons to Montello was aimed at possession of the main
        roads leading to Montebelluna, Treviso, and Mestre, five miles west of
        Venice, thereby cutting off Venice and thrusting toward the heart of
        the Venetian Plain.</p>

        <p>In the meantime General Conrad von Hoetendorf's armies from Monte
        Grappa to Asiago were to sweep down upon Asolo and Bassano to prevent
        the retreat of the 3d Italian Army from the Piave and complete the
        march of invasion from the north.</p>

        <p>Austria's hopes and aims are reflected very strikingly in an Order
        of the Day, dated June 14, compiled from Field Marshal Boroevic's
        proclamation and circulated among the troops of the 3d Regiment over
        Commander Mitteregger's signature. A copy has just fallen into Italian
        hands. It runs as follows:</p>

        <p>From the Adige to the Adriatic the Austrian Army descends into the
        field against Italy. All the forces and all the material of the
        monarchy are for the first time massed against one single enemy as the
        outcome of preparations begun many months ago. Tomorrow the Italian
        command will learn this tremendous news from the mouths of our guns.
        The entire Italian front will be attacked, and to free himself from our
        iron grip, which will encircle his whole front, the enemy would be
        obliged to engage reserves far vaster than those at his disposal.</p>

        <p>From trench warfare we shall pass to that of movement and shall
        occupy a country abounding in victuals and stores of every sort. Let us
        therefore press forward resolutely toward the City of Verona, where a
        century ago the august founder of our regiment stood victor against the
        combined armies of France and Italy.</p>

        <p>Today, (June 17,) nevertheless, after forty-eight hours of fighting,
        the enemy still is held upon his first lines.</p>

        <p>The British forces regained all the positions they held on the eve
        of the battle. The French contingents southeast of Asiago on Turcio
        Road recaptured Pennar in a bayonet charge and drove the Austrians back
        far beyond their starting point. Counterattacking at Cornone, our
        allies stopped effectually the enemy's dash toward Valstagna and took
        500 prisoners. Fenilon and Moschin Mountains, overlooking the Brenta
        Valley, which the enemy overwhelmed in his first onrush, have also been
        retaken at the point of the bayonet, with 200 prisoners and forty
        machine guns.</p>

        <p>Along the Piave enemy masses concentrated, chiefly on the eastern
        slopes on Montello and west of San Dona. In both districts<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_34" name="Page_34">[Pg 34]</a></span> passage
        across the river was facilitated by a heavy rain of tear shells and
        smoke bombs, and amid the smoke pontoons and rafts were taken down to
        the water's edge. Three divisions got across from Colfosco and Ilas,
        fronting Nervesa, but they were hemmed around at the foot of Montello,
        at Fagare and Zenson, where the Austrians had penetrated some way
        ahead. The Italians, after thrusting them from the latter place,
        encircled some detachments in the river bend.</p>

        <p>Croce Village, west of San Dona, was rewon and lost twice over, and
        now rests in the possession of Italian bombardiers, Bersagliere, and
        cyclist corps. But the best stroke of luck on the Piave occurred in the
        Saletto sector. Taking advantage of numerous islets at this point,
        where the river is nearly two miles wide, one Hungarian battalion of
        the 96th Regiment had safely crossed, and was being quickly followed by
        another. Italian gunfire smashed its boats, flinging the occupants into
        the water. Many were carried away and drowned in the rapid currents,
        while over a thousand survivors, including a Lieutenant Colonel, a
        Major, and thirty other officers, out of the haul of 3,000 odd
        prisoners taken during the day, were made captives by the Italians at
        that spot.</p>

        <p>The Austrians employed such a large amount of gases that the whole
        battleline was enveloped in dense, impenetrable clouds. Fortunately, a
        heavy rain fell in that region, which lessened to some extent the
        effects of the gases.</p>

        <p>The Italians fought fiercely with great dash, glad to get at the
        enemy after so many months of forced inactivity and with an intense
        desire to regain the country desecrated by the enemy's invasion.</p>

        <p>The Austrians kept the Italians under deadly fire, especially aiming
        at their second lines, to prevent the arrival of reinforcements. This
        bombardment has small effect in the mountains, as, owing to the limited
        number of men one can employ at one time, these are able to protect
        themselves in dugouts excavated in the solid rock.</p>

        <p>Snow, which is still lying on the mountains, is heaped up into
        immense mounds by the bombardment. Italian troops, clothed in white
        overalls to prevent their being seen against the whiteness, slowly
        advanced to engage the enemy in hand-to-hand fighting.</p>

        <p>Despite the rain, the work accomplished by the English and Italian
        aviators was above praise. Flying low over the enemy troops, they
        brought confusion and terror into their midst, intrepidly engaging the
        Austrians in aerial combats, and bringing down in twelve hours many
        enemy planes, while also collecting invaluable military information.
        The English and French contingents co-operated with the Italians in
        perfect accord and a splendid spirit of camaraderie.</p>

        <p>Except for lack of secrecy, the Austrians organized this supreme
        effort of theirs better than might have been expected. It was well
        planned and resolutely delivered. The credit due the Italians is all
        the greater for repulsing it completely in many places, containing it
        in others, and nowhere allowing it to break through.</p>

        <p>The sector on which the enemy gained most ground is on the Piave.
        There the Austrians made three principal crossings of the river and
        established three bridgeheads or salients into the original Italian
        line.</p>

        <p>To make this possible they blinded the Italian artillery and
        airplanes by using great quantities of smoke shells which covered the
        river and the Italian trenches on its bank with a dense black fog. Thus
        hidden, the Austrian patrols hurried across the water in boats and on
        rafts under no more than a random fire from the defense.</p>

        <p>Having reached the western bank they pulled pontoon bridges across
        and pushed reinforcements rapidly forward. The most notable of these
        crossings was the enemy's penetration in the Montello sector, the
        position which the British forces held all last Winter.</p>

        <p>This sector is the hinge between the mountain and the Piave sectors;
        it stands at the angle where the Piave leaves the mountains and enters
        the Venetian Plain. It is an isolated hog's back, 700 feet high in the
        middle and seven and a half miles long, running almost east and west,
        with the foot of its northern and eastern slopes washed by the river,
        its surface undulating, dotted with farms and little woods—an unusual
        feature—crossed from north to south by no fewer than twenty-four roads.
        The value of Montello to the enemy would have been that it would
        dominate from the flank and rear all the Italian positions defending
        the line of the Piave in the dead flat plain to the south.</p>

        <p>The British, after reconquering the advanced positions, momentarily
        abandoned on June 15 with a view of strengthening the line, not only
        resisted all Austrian attempts, but counterattacked in a fashion that
        caused an Italian superior officer to remark: "They are slamming the
        gates of Italy in the face of the invader."</p>

        <p><i>In a dispatch on June 19 Mr. West recorded the fact that the
        enemy, while maintaining pressure on the mountain front and Montello
        district, was redoubling his efforts on the Piave especially west of
        San Dona. The dispatch continues</i>:</p>

        <p>The Austrian hold of the last-named vicinity, also in the Zenson
        bend and at Saint Andrea, southeast of Montello, is being considerably
        weakened by the Italian artillery fire and constant counterattacks.</p>

        <p>Saint Andrea itself, with the adjacent villages of Giavera, Bavaria,
        and Sovilla, has changed hands ten times over. The railroad running
        thence toward Montebelluna is hidden under a litter of dead bodies for
        a length of several kilometers. The haul of prisoners has risen from
        6,000 to 9,000, General Diaz announced last night—an almost unique fact
        in an offensive of this nature and undoubtedly<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_35" name="Page_35">[Pg 35]</a></span> the fruit
        of Italy's immediate readiness for an energetic reaction.</p>

        <p>Stupendous acts of heroism are recorded. Gunners of an Alpine
        regiment stationed at the foot of Montello Hill, after being twice
        driven from their batteries, united themselves to some storm troops,
        fought the foe in a hand-to-hand encounter with daggers, and,
        recovering the cannon, readjusted the breechlocks, which they had taken
        away with them, and then fired pointblank into the adversary's
        ranks.</p>

        <p>At Fagare two Hungarian battalions were annihilated amid the ruins
        of houses where they had taken refuge. At Candelu an enemy machine-gun
        corps, which had transformed the village into a fort, were killed by
        Italian mountain artillery, and in the neighboring sector of Salettuol
        the 3d Austrian Division lost 60 per cent. of its effectiveness.</p>

        <p>Many of the prisoners at the moment of capture present the
        appearance of Bedouins, being clad merely in tattered shirts, with
        their rifles slung over their shoulders and a dagger in their hand.
        Nearly all carried postcard maps marking out their journey, with a
        program inscribed: "June 15, halt at Treviso. June 16, occupation of
        Venice." They also carried little packets of money coupons printed in
        Italian for spending in those cities.</p>

        Recent Offensive</h3>

        <p class="center">[<span class="smcap">By the Cologne Gazette Editor at
        German Headquarters</span>]</p>

        <p>The task confronting us before the offensive seemed monstrous. What
        the combined and many times superior armies of the Napoleonic School
        and Kitchener's Army, young indeed but drawing its supplies from the
        resources of a world empire, had failed to accomplish against a force
        of almost Frederickian inferiority in numbers, this task was to be
        performed by the German Army, which, even after the absorption of the
        eastern units, was scarcely equal in strength, much less superior to
        the enemy. The big hammer had failed to beat down the little hammer; it
        was now the turn of the little hammer to pit itself against the big
        hammer. The German hinterland, diminutive in comparison with the
        continents working for the coalition, was not only to hold its own, but
        also to help to conquer in battle against the raw materials and
        industries of half Europe, America, Africa, and Asia. The German
        victory at Cambrai, which in a sense represented a transition from the
        old to a new era in the history of the war in the west, had already
        illuminated the difficulties that a brave and numerically superior
        enemy could oppose to our attack.</p>

        <p>In contrast with the victorious confidence of our veteran defense
        troops—a confidence that at times excited the amazement of their own
        leaders—the enemy continued to contemplate the German undertaking with
        inveterate skepticism. British and French prisoners captured during the
        Winter months indeed held out to us the prospect of achieving an
        initial success similar to that which their own offensive had achieved.
        But nowhere in the world did any one reckon upon more than the
        customary initial success for our enterprise.</p>

        <p>The German High Command decided from the very outset not to fight a
        "battle of matériel," but to build up success upon a more ideal
        foundation. Numerical inferiority was to be compensated by the warlike
        and moral qualities peculiar to the German Army organism. The same
        virtues that had proved the essential cause of the enemy's defeat were
        to form the surest guarantees of German victory. To the undeniable
        bravery of the English and French storming troops was to be opposed the
        utmost bravery of the German tribes; the good quality of the enemy
        leaders was to be met by better leading on the German side, and the
        thorough preparation of our adversaries by one still more thorough.</p>

        <p>As the Supreme Command could confidently reckon upon the two first
        as given quantities, there remained as the chief task the preparation
        of the attack. Unity of command and of forces, the latter non-German
        only in respect of a<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_36" name=
        "Page_36">[Pg 36]</a></span> valuable group of Austrian batteries that
        had been placed in the line, facilitated the tremendous work. Frictions
        and impediments that are inherent even in the best organized coalition
        armies were spared us. It is impossible to picture what was
        accomplished in the map rooms of the German staffs by experienced
        specialists in defensive warfare, who worked in silence for months, at
        the highest nervous pressure, in the face of the confident expectation
        of the homeland and growing tension and impatience abroad. But it is
        certain that an altogether enormous expenditure of organizing energy
        was required in order to impart the method of attack; to ascertain and
        control the situation of the enemy; to supply the striking force with
        munitions and provisions; and finally to produce that masterpiece, the
        veiled march into line.</p>

        <p>He Extols Militarism and Defines the Issues of the War</p>

        <p>The German Kaiser in two telegrams acknowledging congratulations on
        the thirtieth anniversary of his accession to the throne made
        announcements of historic interest regarding the issues of the war and
        the uses of militarism. On June 17 he telegraphed to the German
        Chancellor, Count von Hertling:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>I express cordial thanks and kind good wishes to your Excellency
            and the State Ministry on the day on which, thirty years ago, I
            ascended the throne. When I celebrated my twenty-five-year jubilee
            as ruler I was able, with special gratitude, to point out that I
            had been able to do my work as a prince of peace. Since then the
            world picture has changed. For nearly four years, forced to it by
            our enemies, we have been engaged in the hardest struggle history
            records. God the Lord has laid a heavy burden upon my shoulders,
            but I carry it in the consciousness of our good right, with
            confidence in our ship, our sword, and our strength, and in the
            realization that I have the good fortune to stand at the head of
            the most capable people on earth. Just as our arms under strong
            leadership have proved themselves invincible, so also will the home
            land, exerting all its strength, bear with strong will the
            sufferings and privations which just now are keenly felt.</p>

            <p>Thus, I have spent this day 'midst my armies, and it moved me to
            the depths of my heart, yet filled with the most profound gratitude
            to God's mercy.</p>

            <p>I know that Prussian militarism, so much abused by our enemies,
            which my forefathers and I, in a spirit of dutifulness, loyalty,
            order, and obedience, have nurtured, has given Germany's sword and
            the German Nation strength to triumph, and that victory will bring
            a peace which will guarantee the German life.</p>

            <p>It will then be my sacred duty, as well as that of the States,
            with all our power to see to healing the wounds caused by the war
            and to secure a happy future for the nation. In most faithful
            recognition of the work hitherto performed, I rely on your approved
            strength and the help of the State Ministry. God bless our land and
            people!</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>In an address at Main Headquarters on June 15 he said that the war
        was not a matter of strategic campaign, but a struggle of two world
        views wrestling with each other. "Either German principles of right,
        freedom, honor, and morality must be upheld," he added, "or Anglo-Saxon
        principles with their idolatry of mammon must be victorious."</p>

        <p>The Anglo-Saxons, he asserted, aimed at making the peoples of the
        world work as slaves for the Anglo-Saxon ruling race, and such a matter
        could not be decided in days or weeks, or even in a year.</p>

        <p>The Emperor emphasized the fact that from the first he had realized
        that the trials of war would be great. The first outbreak of enthusiasm
        had not deceived him. Great Britain's intervention had meant a world
        struggle, whether he desired it or not. He said he was thankful that
        Field Marshal von Hindenburg and General Ludendorff had been placed at
        his side as counselors. Drinking to the health of the army and its
        leaders, the Emperor said:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The German people and army indeed are now one and the same and
            look up to you with gratitude. Every man out there <span class=
            "pagenum"><a id="Page_37" name="Page_37">[Pg 37]</a></span>knows
            what he is fighting for, the enemy himself admits that, and in
            consequence we shall gain victory—the victory of the German
            standpoint. That is what is in question.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>The Emperor referred to the period of peace, which he described as
        "twenty-six years of profitable but hard work, though they could not
        always be regarded as successful in a political respect and had brought
        disappointments."</p>

        <p>His interests had been centred in the work connected with the
        development of the army and the effort to maintain it at the level at
        which it had been intrusted to him. Now, in time of war, he could not
        better celebrate the day than under the same roof with the Field
        Marshal and his faithful, highly gifted Generals and General Staff. The
        Emperor continued:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>In peace time in the preparation of my army for war my
            grandfather's war comrades gradually passed away, and as the German
            horizon gradually darkened, many a German, and not the least I,
            hoped with assurance that God would in this danger place the right
            man at our side. Our hope has not been disappointed.</p>

            <p>In your Excellency and in you, General Ludendorff, Heaven
            bestowed upon the German Empire and the German Army and staff men
            who are called upon in these great times to lead the German people
            in arms in its decisive struggle for existence and the right to
            live, and with its help to gain victory.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>He sent the following telegram to the Crown Prince:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>Under your leadership the armies of Generals von Boehm, von
            Below, and von Hutier have severely defeated the enemy and
            shattered the storm of his hurriedly brought-up army reserves.
            Eighty-five thousand prisoners and more than 1,000 guns are the
            outward signs of this tremendous battle success. To you and the
            participating commanders and troops I express my thanks and those
            of the Fatherland. The fighting spirit and fighting strength of my
            incomparable troops guarantee our final victory. God will further
            help.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>Field Marshal von Hindenburg, in congratulating the Emperor on
        behalf of the army, extolled the Emperor's "wise care for peace" during
        the first twenty-six years of his reign and Germany's brilliant
        progress in all works of peace in that period. If the German Army and
        people had been able for nearly four years in the face of a world of
        enemies to show such proof of their strength and right to existence as
        never yet in history had been demanded and given in such measure, he
        added, they also owed this to their war lord, who had indefatigably
        watched over the fighting efficiency of his armies. The Field Marshal
        renewed the unswerving loyalty until death of Germany's sons at the
        front, and concluded:</p>

        <p>"May our old motto, 'Forward with God for King and Fatherland, for
        Kaiser and Empire,' result in many years of peace being granted to your
        Majesty after our victorious return home."</p>

        Germany</h2>

        <p>Evidence that the war has brought a great increase of crime in
        Germany is forthcoming in many forms. At a conference held in Berlin
        early in 1918 to discuss "public insecurity" in all parts of Germany,
        it was stated that most of the burglaries and other crimes were
        committed during the nights between Friday and Monday. Statistics were
        given of the payments made by companies which issue insurance policies
        against burglary and theft. Payments on account of burglaries increased
        from $400,000 in 1914 to $1,100,000 in 1916, and to about $5,000,000 in
        1917. Compensation for stolen goods to the amount of nearly $15,000,000
        was paid by the Prussian railways in 1917, as compared with a total of
        only $1,050,000 in 1914.</p>

        <p>Owing to the constant thefts of food in Berlin an official order has
        been issued that no wheat or flour is to be moved through the streets
        after dark. The theft of letters is becoming more and more common. One
        night nineteen letter-boxes in Charlottenburg were broken open, and the
        letters were destroyed after the postage stamps had been torn off.
        Owing to frequent thefts of letters at a small town named Mittenwalde,
        the Postmaster laid a trap for the thief, with the result that his own
        wife has been sent to prison for six months.</p>

        Waters</h2>

        <h3>Twenty Vessels, Mostly in the Coastwise Trade, Sunk Off the New
        Jersey and Virginia Coasts</h3>

        <p>One or more German submarines—the number was not definitely
        established—appeared off the coast of the United States on May 25,
        1918, and began sinking merchant ships on a large scale. Up to June 20
        more than twenty steamers and sailing vessels, mostly of American
        register, had been sent to the bottom.</p>

        <p>This was the second visit of an armed German submarine to the
        American side of the Atlantic for hostile action. In October, 1916,
        before the United States entered the war, the U-53 held up coastwise
        traffic off Nantucket and sank four British, one Dutch, and one
        Norwegian ship. The U-53 had been preceded by the merchant submarine
        Deutschland, which arrived at Baltimore on July 9, 1916, from Bremen
        and returned with a cargo of nickel and rubber. The Deutschland made a
        second trip, arriving at New London, Conn., in October.</p>

        <p>The appearance off the American coast of the unidentified submarine,
        or submarines, which made the raid on American and neutral shipping in
        May and June, 1918, was not altogether unexpected. For several weeks
        the American naval authorities had been searching for U-boats in home
        waters in consequence of a dispatch from the British Admiralty stating
        that two German submarines of the latest type, with a cruising capacity
        of 10,000 miles, had left the North Sea and were observed proceeding
        westward, probably in an attempt to cross the Atlantic.</p>

        <p>The first information that German U-boats were conducting a
        transatlantic campaign was brought to New York City on June 4 by
        Captain Humphrey G. Newcombe and the ten members of the crew of the
        American four-masted schooner Edward H. Cole, which was sunk with bombs
        on the afternoon of June 2, fifty miles southeast of Barnegat, N. J.
        All were agreed that the U-boat was about 200 feet long, of more than
        20 feet beam, and with 5 feet freeboard, that it carried a three-inch
        gun fore and aft, and a one-pounder quick-firer amidships, and that it
        had a speed of 17 knots. The mate of the Edward H. Cole told how he had
        noticed a submarine moving around the vessel at a high speed and
        believed that it was an American craft with Naval Reserve cadets on
        board, who were trying to have some fun with the sailors of the
        merchant ship.</p>

        <p>"I thought," the mate continued, "that it would be a good idea to
        have a little fun with our skipper, who had turned in for a nap in his
        cabin, and I yelled down the skylight, 'Tumble up on deck lively, Cap!
        There's a big German submarine close astern, getting ready to attack
        us.' Then I took the marine glasses and looked through them at the
        stern of the U-boat, where her ensign was flapping limply against the
        short flagstaff. For a moment or two I could not make out her
        nationality, and then a gust of wind came and blew the ensign straight
        so that I could see that it was the German flag, and then I shouted in
        earnest to Captain Newcombe, 'It's no joke this time. By gosh, she is a
        German submarine!'"</p>

        <p>The schooners Hattie Dunn and Edna were the first vessels sunk—on
        May 25. Their crews, as well as that of the schooner Hauppauge, which
        was sunk three days later, numbering twenty-three men, were taken on
        board the submarine and kept prisoner there for eight days. When the
        tank steamer Isabel Wiley was sunk, on June 2, the twenty-three
        prisoners were placed, with the crew of the Isabel Wiley, in the
        tanker's four boats and left to find their way to the shore. They were
        picked up by a coastwise steamer and brought safely back to land.</p>

        <p>Captain Charles E. Holbrook of the Hattie Dunn, the first skipper to
        encounter<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_39" name="Page_39">[Pg
        39]</a></span> the U-boat, thus described his experience:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>We left New York for Charleston in ballast on May 23, and when,
            two days later, we were about fifteen miles south of Winter Quarter
            Lightship bowling along under an eight-knot breeze, I heard a shell
            pass near the vessel. Then another shell, which fell perhaps a
            quarter of a mile away. I was not taking much notice, because I
            believed the vessel which I saw about two miles away was an
            American submarine at target practice.</p>

            <p>A third shell exploded close by us on the weather quarter, and I
            knew that, whoever it was, wanted us to stop. I brought the vessel
            up into the wind. The submarine, with her superstructure and
            conning tower showing plainly above the water, came within two
            hundred yards, and I saw that she was flying the two code letters
            "A B," meaning "stop immediately."</p>

            <p>From a small staff at the rear end of the superstructure
            fluttered a small flag of the Imperial German Navy. An officer and
            three men came over in a small boat, not over twelve feet long. In
            perfect English the officer told us to get into our boats and that
            we had but ten minutes allotted to us to get clear of our vessel.
            They placed bombs along the sides of our vessel and blew her up
            immediately, in the meantime putting an armed German sailor on
            board the small boat in which were seven men and myself. This did
            not give me time to rescue my personal effects and nautical
            instruments. My men only saved what they stood in.</p>

            <p>Perhaps I would have been given more time if the commander of
            the submarine had not seen the Hauppauge under full sail about four
            or five miles away. Like us the Hauppauge was light, and, I
            understand, was bound from Portland to Newport News. He destroyed
            Captain Sweeney's fine new schooner after ordering him and his crew
            to take to their boats, and within a half hour both crews were on
            board the submarine and both the small boats had been placed on the
            submarine's deck and lashed down.</p>

        THE U-BOAT</h3>

        <p>Captain C. M. Gilmore of the Edna said that when he was stopped by
        the U-boat an officer came aboard and told him he had ten minutes to
        abandon ship. During the week he was on board the submarine, Captain
        Gilmore said the Americans were treated with such extreme courtesy by
        the Germans that it was evident that the whole matter was being done
        under orders with the hope of having an effect on American public
        opinion. Captain Gilmore added:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>The officers of the submarine included a spare Captain who was
            apparently on hand to take charge of any prize that might be worth
            while turning into a raider, the commander of the U-boat itself,
            and two others. These gave up their berths to me and the master of
            the Hattie Dunn, and the Germans of the crew gave up their bunks to
            the sailors and slept in hammocks themselves. The officers gave us
            wines, cordials, and fine cigars, and in general treated us with
            such marked hospitality that it seemed apparent that they were
            carrying out a course that had been laid upon them. The commander
            said that he had fuel and supplies for a month in American waters
            and intended to stay here for that time before going back.</p>

        <p>The Carolina, a 5,000-ton passenger steamship belonging to the New
        York and Porto Rico Steamship Line, which was sunk at 6 P. M. on June
        2, had on board the largest number of persons of any of the ships
        destroyed. Passengers and crew numbered 331. All escaped except seven
        out of the twenty-six who were put on board on a motor launch. The
        launch encountered a heavy storm and overturned. Christian Nelson,
        Chief Engineer of the Carolina, who was in charge of the launch, after
        a great effort managed to right it, but in the meanwhile seven persons
        had disappeared in the sea. With the aid principally of a young Porto
        Rican girl, who did not understand English, but who behaved very
        intelligently and bravely, Nelson kept the launch afloat, although it
        was waterlogged and the engine would not work. The launch was finally
        picked up by a British freighter, which took the survivors into Lewes,
        Del. The rest of the passengers and crew of the Carolina were picked up
        by other vessels and safely landed. Some of the survivors were more
        than twenty hours at sea in open boats.</p>

        <p>All the ships mentioned were sunk except the Herbert L. Pratt and
        the Edna. Most of them were destroyed by bombs placed alongside after
        the crews had left. In some cases gunfire was used. The submarine also
        laid mines, which caused some damage. The commander of the submarine
        was reported as saying that he was saving his torpedoes for bigger
        ships. With the exception of the British and Norwegian vessels all were
        American. The raid extended along the coast from within a couple of
        hundred miles of New York southward as far as the entrance to
        Chesapeake Bay.</p>

        THE RAIDER</h3>

        <p>As soon as the first news was received that a submarine campaign was
        being conducted off the American coast, prompt action was taken by the
        Navy Department. Destroyers, submarine chasers, and airplanes were sent
        out in large numbers to patrol the coast and search the neighboring
        waters, but the U-boat eluded detection. New York Harbor was
        temporarily closed, and, though there was no indication of the presence
        of hostile airplanes, the lighting of the city was for several nights
        diminished by darkening the main thoroughfares. There were rumors that
        the submarine either had a "mother ship" or was using a base on the
        Mexican coast. Marine insurance rates were not raised, but the officers
        of vessels in the coastwise trade were granted a bonus by the Shipping
        Board.</p>

        Activities of the Month</h2>

        <p>The British Admiralty's official statement of all losses of shipping
        during the month of April, 1918, shows that 220,709 tons of British and
        84,393 tons of allied and neutral vessels, a total of 305,102 tons,
        were destroyed by submarines and lost by accident. The total for the
        preceding month was 381,631 tons. In April, 1917, the total losses
        amounted to 893,877. April, 1918, showed the lowest figures for any
        month since the beginning of 1917. Another satisfactory feature of the
        situation was that 40,000 tons more shipping was built by Great Britain
        and the United States than was lost during the month.</p>

        <p>Georges Leygues, the French Minister of Marine, informed the Army
        and Navy War Committees of the Senate on May 25 that the means employed
        to rid the seas of submarines had become increasingly effective since
        January and had given decisive results. Tremendous strides had recently
        been made by the Allies in repairing ships damaged by torpedoes or
        mines. The Minister added that co-ordination between the allied nations
        had become so smooth during the past four months that the tonnage
        restored to the sea exceeded 500,000 weekly. Great Britain had repaired
        598,000 tons in one week recently, while France had effected repairs
        upon 260,000 tons in one month. The increased building and more
        efficient and speedier repair work were constantly bringing better
        results in the transport of troops and supplies.</p>

        <p>Twelve German submarines were sunk or captured in British waters by
        the American and British destroyers during the month of April, which
        was a record. This means that twelve U-boats were officially reported
        and recognized as sunk and that evidence, either a ca pbearing the name
        of the submarine, a portion of the craft, or a live or dead German, was
        produced when each case was recorded.</p>

        <p>In addition to this number, at least two other U-boats were
        destroyed during that period. One was sunk on April 8 in the North Sea
        while making an attack on a convoy to Holland. Another U-boat, making
        the total fourteen, was sunk on Friday, April 26, during the forenoon
        while attempting to attack a convoy of transports filled with American
        troops on the way to France. In the case of these two U-boats no débris
        or other direct evidence was recovered, and the British Admiralty
        accordingly withheld official recognition.</p>

        <p>Senator Swanson of Virginia, a member of the Senate Naval Committee,
        made the statement on June 7 that the allied and American naval forces
        had destroyed 60 per cent. of all German submarines constructed.
        Senator Lodge of Massachusetts on June 15 said that since Jan. 1, 1918,
        the United States Navy had sunk twenty-eight German submarines.</p>

        <p>The American troop transport President Lincoln, 18,168 gross tons,
        was sunk by a German submarine on May 31 while returning under convoy
        from Europe. The ship was struck simultaneously by three torpedoes and
        sank in eighteen minutes. Three other vessels were in company with her
        at the same time. The crew and passengers abandoned the ship in
        excellent order. All passengers, including the sick, were saved. One of
        the American destroyers which went to the rescue saved 500 persons, and
        another destroyer the remainder of the survivors. The number missing
        was twenty-seven, comprising four officers and twenty-three enlisted
        men. One of the officers was taken prisoner by the submarine.</p>

        <p>The British armed mercantile troop-ship Moldavia, with American
        troops on board, was torpedoed and sunk on May 23. Of the American
        soldiers fifty-six were reported by the British Admiralty as
        "unaccounted for." The British transport Ausonia was torpedoed and sunk
        on May 26. Forty of the officers and crew were reported missing. The
        British transport Leasowe Castle was torpedoed and sunk by an enemy
        submarine May 26 in the Mediterranean. Thirteen military officers and
        seventy-nine of other ranks, and of the ship's company the Captain, two
        wireless operators, and six of other ratings were drowned.</p>

        <h3>Rescue of a Submarine Crew Imprisoned Fathoms Deep for Three
        Days</h3>

        <p>By an act which must stand among the most heroic in the records of
        the war, Commander Francis H. H. Goodhart sacrificed his life to save
        the crew of a British submarine, fast in the mud in thirty-eight feet
        of water. It was in the first week of May, 1918, that the commander's
        vessel found itself in this perilous plight. When the air supply of the
        imprisoned men was about exhausted, Goodhart entered the conning tower,
        giving instructions that he was to be blown upward in the hope of
        reaching the surface and bringing aid to the imperiled crew. As he
        entered the tower with the senior officer a small tin cylinder
        containing instructions for rescuers was fastened to his belt, and the
        commander's last words were: "If I don't get up, the cylinder
        will."</p>

        <p>Air at high pressure had been forced into the conning tower, and the
        lid was opened. Taking a deep breath, Commander Goodhart was shot
        upward, but he struck a portion of the superstructure and was
        killed.</p>

        <p>The senior officer, who had intended to remain in the submarine, was
        forced from the tower by the air pressure and reached the surface
        safely. The remainder of the crew was rescued soon afterward. A
        posthumous reward of the Albert Medal for gallantry in saving life at
        sea was conferred on Commander Goodhart.</p>

        <p>The sufferings of the crew were thus described by one of the rescued
        sailors in a letter to The London Telegraph:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>When the first night of imprisonment passed, and it appeared
            from our watches—we had artificial light enough to see the
            time—that the dawn of a new day had come with no sign of release,
            some of the company threatened to chuck hope. But others of us put
            as bright a face on a black outlook as we could, and gave them such
            cheer as a waterless and breadless situation would allow. Of
            course, too, we had to remember that our air supply was running
            out.</p>

            <p>Speak of dropping sovereigns down a well! Every tick of my watch
            I knew was as a lost sovereign, so far as air was concerned. But
            those of us who were blessed with big batteries of optimism did our
            best to distribute the current, and so the time dragged on. Then a
            great thing happened. Two heroes came forward and offered to risk
            all in an attempt to win to the surface. All honor to them! How
            they did it and at what a cost may be told later on, but the thing
            was done, and the outer world was thus made aware of our terrible
            plight. That much we realized when we knew of the presence of
            divers about our craft. What a relief! We had been located,
            practical measures were being taken for our salvage, and that
            splendid prospect made us take in a draught of new life. Artificial
            light was fast failing, but hope was burning brightly, so what did
            it matter?</p>

            <p>Our ordeal, as it turned out, was but a young thing as yet,
            however. We had still a long way to go. The day dragged through,
            and when we entered on the silence and uncertainty of the night we
            were a forlorn enough lot, I can assure you. The nerve of the
            toughest of us was wearing thin. My fear that it might snap
            suddenly all round was not realized, however, for we were given
            further indications, which our practical ears were not slow to
            catch, that the great work of rescue was well in hand. The constant
            tapping of the divers outside was a cheering sound, and brought
            hope to those of us who, in the steadily increasing stifle of the
            atmosphere, were now breathing hard to live.</p>

            <p>But rescue was long delayed, and in the early hours of the
            following day most of us wrote our last farewell to our loved
            ones—short, tender messages scrawled in pencil—and some of us made
            our wills. Then, as if by a miracle, three strong strands in the
            ladder of escape came to us from above. Exactly in what manner this
            was made possible I cannot tell you. We got air, water, and food,
            in only the smallest quantities, but just enough to stir us into
            new life. That was a godsend as welcome as it was unexpected. And
            we had not to wait long for the opening of our prison door. When
            the details of that liberation are given it will cause surprise and
            congratulation everywhere. It verges on the miraculous. When we
            scrambled into freedom we were a dazed and shaken lot of men, but
            I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_43" name="Page_43">[Pg
            43]</a></span> warrant you our hearts were full of gratitude to God
            for saving mercies.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>It was left to others to give fuller details of the impression
        caused by the unexpected arrival of the three "strands" in the life
        ladder. The first was air—life-giving air—which was forced into the
        stifling compartment from above. The boon came just in time; the
        prisoners had had about fifty hours of captivity, their last light was
        burning dimly, and the atmosphere of their prison house was vile. More
        than one of the company had lost consciousness, but the effect of the
        tiny air current was instantaneous. The senseless men stirred as if in
        troubled sleep, and opened their eyes, breathing hard, while those of
        the company who had stood up to the ordeal with all their senses about
        them felt instantly the glorious effect of the air draught.</p>

        <p>The second strand was water—fresh, cold water—also forced down by
        the splendid salvage party. The quantity was very small—only a sip to
        each—but, oh! the refreshment of it! "We were parched in lip and mouth
        and throat," said one of the prisoners, "and never was a drop of water
        more welcome." The third strand was food, pellets of compressed food.
        The salvage party had accomplished almost the impossible. And this was
        not their greatest achievement. It was the forcing of a way of escape
        for the entombed men that was the marvel. Ingenuity backed up by
        tireless tenacity, resourcefulness that absolutely refused to own
        either defeat or despair, triumphed over difficulties that seemed
        insuperable.</p>

        <p>What a picture for brush or pen is offered in the scene of rescue in
        the dead of night, when these dazed prisoners won once again their
        liberty. They came forth in single file from the prison house. Near the
        head of the procession was a bronzed sailor, one whose coolness in the
        dragging hours of extremity had done much to maintain the flickering
        life of his comrades. He thrust out at arm's length his oilskin, and
        followed with a wonderfully nimble step, thus providing the only touch
        of lightness in the grim tragedy.</p>

        <p>Shelter was awaiting them, and from there they dispatched hurried
        messages to loved ones at home, to relieve hearts nearly broken by
        suspense. And a while later a grateful little company heard read to
        them by one of the survivors the metrical version of the 124th Psalm.
        They needed no preacher to interpret to them its beauty and its
        significance—for they had been there, and they knew:</p>

        <p>The May deliveries comprised thirty-nine requisitioned steel
        vessels, four contract steel and one contract wooden ship. In the last
        six days of the month there were delivered one wooden and fourteen
        steel ships, totaling 82,760 tons. The<span class="pagenum"><a id=
        "Page_44" name="Page_44">[Pg 44]</a></span> best previous week was that
        ended May 4, when the deliveries totaled 80,180 tons.</p>

        <p>Launchings kept pace with the number of ships completed. Among the
        vessels launched in May was the Agawam, the first "fabricated" ship in
        the world, "fabricated" being the technical term applied to ships built
        from numbered pieces made from patterns. Approximately 27 steel mills,
        56 fabricating plants, and 200 foundries, machine, pipe, and equipment
        shops were engaged in the production of the parts.</p>

        <p>On June 1 it was unofficially stated that there were in operation by
        the United States Government 2,200,000 deadweight tons of shipping
        engaged in the transportation of troops and supplies and in kindred
        work for the army. Reviewing the shipping situation as a whole, Edward
        N. Hurley, Chairman of the Shipping Board, in an address on June 10,
        said:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>On June 1 we had increased the American-built tonnage to over
            3,500,000 deadweight tons of shipping. This gives us a total of
            more than 1,400 ships, with an approximate total deadweight tonnage
            of 7,000,000 now under the control of the United States Shipping
            Board.</p>

            <p>In round numbers, and from all sources, we have added to the
            American flag since our war against Germany began nearly 4,500,000
            tons of shipping.</p>

            <p>Our program calls for the building of 1,856 passenger, cargo,
            and refrigerator ships and tankers, ranging from 5,000 to 12,000
            tons each, with an aggregate deadweight of 13,000,000. Exclusive of
            these, we have 245 commandeered vessels, taken over from foreign
            and domestic owners, which are being completed by the Emergency
            Fleet Corporation. These will aggregate a total deadweight tonnage
            of 1,715,000.</p>

            <p>This makes a total of 2,101 vessels, exclusive of tugs and
            barges, which are being built and will be put on the seas by the
            Emergency Fleet Corporation in the course of carrying out the
            present program, with an aggregate deadweight tonnage of
            14,715,000.</p>

            <p>Five billion dollars will be required to finish our program for
            1918, 1919, and 1920, but the expenditure of this enormous sum will
            give to the American people the greatest merchant fleet ever
            assembled in the history of the world, aggregating 25,000,000
            tons.</p>

            <p>American workmen have made the expansion of recent months
            possible, and they will make possible the successful conclusion of
            the whole program. From all present expectations it is likely that
            by 1920 we shall have close to 1,000,000 men working on American
            merchant ships and their equipment.</p>

            <p>We have a total of 819 shipways in the United States. Of these,
            a total of 751, all of which except ninety are completed, are being
            utilized by the Emergency Fleet Corporation for the building of
            American merchant ships.</p>

            <p>In 1919 the average tonnage of steel, wood, and concrete ships
            continuously building on each way should be about 6,000. If we are
            using 751 ways on cargo ships and can average three ships a year
            per way, we should turn out in one year 13,518,000 tons.</p>

            <p>The total gross revenue of our fleet is very impressive. From
            the ships under the control of the Shipping Board a total gross
            revenue is derived of about $360,000,000.</p>
        </blockquote>

        <p>An appropriation of $1,761,701,000 for the American merchant marine
        was provided in the Sundry Civil bill reported to the House on June 10
        by the Appropriations Committee. The amount recommended for ships and
        shipping was $1,282,694,000 less than the Shipping Board requested, but
        Chairman Sherley explained that receipts from the operation of ships
        could be devoted to building charges, and that no curtailment of the
        building program was contemplated. Of the Shipping Board total
        $1,438,451,000 was for construction in this country, $55,000,000 for
        building American ships abroad, $87,000,000 for establishing shipyards,
        $60,000,000 for operating ships heretofore acquired, and $6,250,000 for
        recruiting and instructing ships' officers.</p>

        <p>As the result of an agreement between the United States and Japanese
        Governments, twenty-three Japanese ships, aggregating 151,166 tons
        deadweight, have been chartered to the United States for the allied
        transport services. On June 4 it was announced that twelve Japanese
        ships, obtained either by purchase or charter, had arrived in Pacific
        ports and were being transferred to the Atlantic Coast.</p>

        <p>More than 400,000 tons of ships were released to the United States
        and the Allies by Sweden under the terms of the commercial agreement
        signed at Stockholm by representatives of the two Governments. Under a
        modus vivendi, in effect for some months, the War Trade<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_45" name="Page_45">[Pg 45]</a></span> Board had
        permitted exports to Sweden in sufficient quantities to meet immediate
        and urgent needs.</p>

        <p>It should be noted that the British practice is to express merchant
        shipbuilding statistics in "gross tons," whereas in the United States
        and some other countries the figures are recorded in "deadweight" tons,
        which is a much higher figure.</p>

        <p>The total ships completed in the shipyards of the United Kingdom
        during the twelve months ended May 31, 1918, were 1,406,838 gross tons.
        The corresponding figures for the year ended April 30, 1917, were
        1,270,337.</p>

        <p>Raising torpedoed ships has become a considerable source of
        increased tonnage for the Allies. According to a report of the British
        Admiralty Salvage Department, made public June 17, no less than 407
        ships sunk by Germans in British waters were salvaged in the years
        between January, 1915, and May, 1918. Up to December, 1917, 260 ships
        were recovered. In the first five months of 1918 the number salvaged
        was 147, the increased rate being due to improved methods.</p>

        <p>Among the difficulties encountered was the danger of poisonous gases
        from the rotting cargoes of sunken ships, which sometimes caused the
        loss of lives. One salvage ship was torpedoed while working on a wreck,
        and sometimes the work of weeks is destroyed by one rough sea. Feats
        performed by the Salvage Department include the raising of a large
        collier sunk in twelve fathoms of water and involving a dead lift of
        3,500 tons. Another vessel was raised fifteen fathoms by the use of
        compressed air.</p>

        <p>Notwithstanding a net loss of the world's shipping, due to the usual
        perils of the sea as well as to enemy mines and submarines, of
        2,632,279 tons from the beginning of the war to April 1, 1918, the
        vital trade route across the Atlantic has shown a steady increase in
        efficiency. Even more gratifying is the fact that in recent weeks the
        gain in efficiency has been accelerated.</p>

        <p>All the essential requirements of our allies as well as of our own
        expeditionary forces abroad appear to be met, according to these
        official statistics from the Department of Commerce. For instance,
        exports of nitric, picric, sulphuric, and other acids, so essential in
        the manufacture of munitions, are going to Europe in a steadily
        increasing volume. Exportsof acids increased from a total value of
        $10,003,647 in the calendar year 1915 to $52,695,640 in 1917. Exports
        of copper, no less necessary for cartridges and other uses, to France,
        Italy, and Great Britain increased from 229,129,587 pounds in 1915 to
        890,819,053 pounds in 1917.</p>

        <p>The same three allies, which needed only 499,719 tons of steel
        billets, blooms, and ingots in the calendar year 1915, took 1,395,019
        tons in 1916 and 1,847,201 tons in 1917. Exports of steel plates to the
        same three allies for ships, tanks, and other military uses increased
        similarly from 63,584,467 pounds in 1915 to 72,242,656 pounds in 1916
        and 165,630,514 pounds in 1917. All Europe took but a negligible
        tonnage of steel rails in 1913, the last full year before the
        war.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_46" name="Page_46">[Pg
        46]</a></span> France alone took 5,362 tons in 1915 and 122,858 tons in
        1917. Exports of locomotives to France kept pace with the rails,
        increasing from 38 in 1915 to 570 in 1917, and 129 in the month of
        January, 1918. Exports of metal-working machinery to these three allies
        increased from a total value of $29,229,683 in 1915 to $47,666,606 in
        1916 and $54,906,405 in 1917.</p>

        <p>Statistics on the exports of barbed wire epitomize the history of
        defensive works by our allies. Italy, for example, took only 2,000
        pounds of that commodity in 1915. Next year her requirements jumped to
        58,367,004 pounds, while last year the necessity of constructing an
        entirely new system of defenses in haste called for 204,972,438 pounds
        of American barbed wire. On the other hand, France, which needed
        264,310,493 pounds of barbed wire in 1916, called for only 29,952,532
        pounds in 1917.</p>

        <p>France, Italy, and England laid in a stock of lead from which to
        make bullets in 1915, the former country taking 21,234,108 pounds,
        Italy 5,176,794 pounds, and Great Britain 81,483,866 pounds. Next year
        total shipments to all three countries fell off to 23,015,071 pounds,
        but rose again to 59,470,181 pounds in 1917, "unrestricted" U-boat
        warfare to the contrary notwithstanding.</p>

        <p>Not all exports of lead went to our allies. Although at peace,
        Denmark, Holland, and Sweden, each and severally, bought more American
        lead in 1916 than Italy needed in any one of three years of desperate
        fighting, total exports to these three neutrals in that year
        aggregating 18,113,859 pounds. Even last year, after the United States
        had declared war against Germany, 3,470,415 pounds of lead went to
        these three neutrals, all of which just happen to drive a thriving
        trade with Germany. The patriots who supplied this brisk neutral demand
        for material from which bullets are made probably would not care to
        trace the shipments to their ultimate effect in swelling American
        casualty list.</p>

        <p>Exports of explosives, including shells and projectiles, increased
        from a total value of $188,969,893 in 1915 to $715,575,306 in 1916. In
        1917, after England and France had attained such marvelous efficiency
        in the production of these essentials of war, exports declined, but
        still reached the enormous total of $633,734,405. Just to show that we
        are keeping our stride in supplying explosives to the firing line the
        fact may be mentioned that in spite of delays due to a lack of bunker
        coal in the unprecedentedly severe month of January, 1918, we shipped
        2,606,297 pounds of dynamite during the month, as compared with
        1,787,600 pounds in January, 1917, and 37,587,662 pounds of powder,
        against 36,767,984 pounds in the corresponding month of 1917.</p>

        <p>Gasoline, the foundation on which present allied supremacy in the
        air is based, and which also plays so great a part in land
        transportation, is going to Great Britain, France, and Italy in swiftly
        increasing volume. Shipments to these three countries in 1915 totaled
        36,936,303 gallons; in 1916, 98,178,139 gallons; in 1917, 141,327,159
        gallons. As a basis of comparison it may be said that America's total
        exports of gasoline to all the world in 1913 amounted to only
        117,728,286 gallons.</p>

        <p>Gasoline engines are going abroad at a similar rate of increase,
        50,317 being shipped in the seven months ended Jan. 31, 1918, as
        compared with 36,209 in the corresponding period of 1916-17.</p>

        <p>So much has been said about submarine losses that the average man
        may be pardoned for accepting the German figures, which have been
        exaggerated from 46 to 113 per cent., and the German delusion that
        England is about to be "brought to her knees" by the modern form of
        piracy. To whatever extent this impression of Prussian frightfulness
        has been disseminated the submarine campaign has been a success; but
        right there success ends. In spite of the utmost the U-boats could do,
        munitions have flowed in steadily increasing volume from America to
        Europe, while the destructiveness of the undersea boats has as steadily
        declined. Furthermore, the fact must not be forgotten that not all
        ships sunk by submarines have been eastbound with cargoes of munitions
        for the Allies. Some have been lost on the westward voyage; others have
        been laden with grain for the starving Belgians, or for neutrals which
        have developed such an astonishing appetite for lard, lead, and other
        things of which Germany stands in need; still others have been hospital
        ships.</p>

        <p>If any further evidence of America's great part in the war,
        irrespective of participation by American troops in the fighting, is
        needed it can be found in statistics of exports of foodstuffs to the
        Allies, who have been obliged to depend more and more upon this country
        for the necessaries of life.</p>

        <p>Exports of wheat flour to France in the calendar year 1915 were
        2,392,952 barrels; in 1916, 2,263,990 barrels; in 1917, 2,659,328
        barrels. Italy called for 148,999 barrels of American wheat flour in
        1915 and 1,494,816 barrels in 1917, while Great Britain's requirements
        were 3,269,262 barrels in the former year and 4,808,141 barrels in the
        latter.</p>

        <p>Our total exports of fresh beef to all the world in 1913 were only
        6,580,123 pounds. In 1915 we sent Great Britain, France, and Italy
        256,198,283 pounds. In 1916 exports to these three countries fell off
        to 160,879,642 pounds, but rose again to 172,940,833 pounds, in spite
        of von Tirpitz's unrestricted destructiveness.</p>

        <p>In 1913 France took only 716,266 pounds of American bacon; but in
        1915 the demand jumped to 52,044,475 pounds, increasing still further
        to 60,606,802 pounds in 1916 and to 73,195,974 pounds in 1917. Great
        Britain, which got along with 145,269,456 pounds of American bacon in
        1913, needed 284,783,009 pounds in 1916 and 341,674,452 pounds in 1917.
        In the same period exports of hams and shoulders to France increased
        more than twelvefold and to Great Britain more than a third.</p>

        <p>Exports of lard to France, Italy, and Great Britain increased from a
        total of 200,490,003 pounds in 1913 to 210,139,760 pounds in 1915 and
        224,683,383 pounds in 1916. In 1917 exports to these three countries
        fell to 189,024,889 pounds. It is an interesting coincidence that
        Holland, whose appetite for American lard was fully satiated by
        38,313,677 pounds in 1913, and which was able to skimp along with a
        trifle more than 20,000,000 pounds a year during the first two years of
        the world war, required 64,888,545 pounds in 1917, when Germany's need
        for fats grew desperate.</p>

        <p>Exports of sugar have gone forward to the Allies on the same vast
        scale. In 1913 our entire export trade absorbed only 14,995,232 pounds
        of sugar. In 1915 we sent to Great Britain, France, and Italy alone
        860,456,311 pounds; in 1916, 1,126,022,067 pounds; in 1917, 519,881,377
        pounds. No wonder the sugar bowl disappeared from the American
        restaurant table last Fall and still remains in strict seclusion!</p>

        <h3><a id="SOLDIERS_AND_CHEWING_GUM" name=
        "SOLDIERS_AND_CHEWING_GUM"></a>SOLDIERS AND CHEWING GUM</h3>

        <p>Not only have we been rendering the Allies a useful service by
        supplying so important a portion of their necessary food and munitions
        of war, but we have been for some months forwarding troops to the
        battleline. No figures are given out regarding movements of troops, but
        there is a significant bit of evidence in the monthly summaries of
        foreign commerce which proves that the number of American fighters
        abroad must be very large. As the Government has published this
        evidence, there can be no harm in referring to it here.</p>

        <p>Gum is not chewed by Europeans, but seems to be regarded as a
        necessary of life in the United States, if the wagging jaws to be seen
        in street cars and other public places are any indication. Well,
        according to Government figures, no chewing gum whatever was exported
        in 1915; but in the calendar year 1917 the value of chewing gum
        exported was $1,403,888! The figures given, being at wholesale prices,
        represent upward of 176,000,000 cuds! Even on the most liberal
        allowance; so vast a quantity would supply a great many fighting
        men.</p>

        <p>Viewed from another standpoint, these chewing-gum statistics are
        even more encouraging. If the shortage of cargo space to allied ports
        were as desperate as Germany's press agents would have us believe, it
        does not seem reasonable to <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_48" name=
        "Page_48">[Pg 48]</a></span>suppose that any part of it would be
        frittered away on chewing gum in such formidable quantities. This
        conviction is strengthened by the discovery that exports of candy have
        increased one-third in the three calendar years of war, to a total of
        $2,108,081 in 1917.</p>

        <p>Most gratifying of all is the fact that despite the utmost endeavors
        of the submarines, and notwithstanding upward of 3,000 strikes in
        American shipyards last year, the capacity and efficiency of
        transatlantic shipping increases from day to day not only positively
        but also negatively by the withdrawal of the heavy tonnage formerly
        serving enemy countries through contiguous neutral nations.</p>

        <p>True, exports fell off somewhat for the eight months ended Feb. 28,
        1918; but Europe received 63 per cent. of the total. Now when Europe is
        spoken of it means substantially England, France, and Italy. Russia
        obtained very little in those eight months, and Germany's neutral
        neighbors still less. The shrinkage in the volume of supplies to our
        fighting partners was not so much on account of anything the submarines
        could do as because of the temporary breakdown of our own system due to
        extraordinarily severe weather and to other causes.</p>

        <p>Now the weather handicap has been lifted, our industrial machine has
        been geared up and more ships have been placed where they could render
        the most effective service. While in February, 1918, we could send our
        allies only 750,000 tons of food, which was 50,000 tons less than their
        minimum requirements, in the next month this was increased to 1,100,000
        tons.</p>

        <p><a id="OUR_NEW_MERCHANT_MARINE" name=
        "OUR_NEW_MERCHANT_MARINE"></a></p>

        <h3>OUR NEW MERCHANT MARINE</h3>

        <p>After having the decadence of the American merchant marine dinned
        into our ears for decades, we may be pardoned for gloating over the way
        this same merchant marine has come back under the stress of war. Of
        total imports worth $1,778,596,695 in 1915, goods valued at
        $342,796,714 arrived in vessels flying the American flag. In 1917 the
        value of goods arriving in American vessels had increased to
        $732,814,858. The increase was the greatest shown by ships of any
        nation, and the total value was the highest for any, British ships
        ranking second with imports valued at $693,565,240. This was a decrease
        of only $7,000,000 from 1915, in spite of all the U-boats could do.
        French ships, fighting the same sneaking foe, were actually able to
        increase the value of goods delivered at American ports from
        $70,275,445 in 1915 to $102,346,317 in 1917, considerably more than
        making up for the decrease in imports arriving under British and
        Italian flags. In the seven months ended Jan. 31, 1918, nearly 29 per
        cent. of all imports arrived in ships flying the American flag.</p>

        <p>And the efficiency curve is still climbing. Up to April 10 America,
        by restricting imports, withdrawing ships from less essential trade
        routes, and by obtaining neutral tonnage by agreement—in other words,
        by good management—had been able to place 2,762,605 tons of shipping in
        the transatlantic service to carry food, munitions, and men to France.
        Of this total, 2,365,344 tons were under American registry. By skillful
        handling in port at both ends of the route the efficiency of this
        tonnage had been increased 20 per cent., which was equivalent to adding
        more than 400,000 tons to the carrying capacity of the fleet as
        compared with normal times.</p>

        <p>These figures include very little of the 500,000 tons of Dutch
        shipping requisitioned, and none at all of the 250,000 tons Japan has
        promised to contribute during the Summer. Neither do they include any
        of the tonnage of England and the other allies which the American
        Shipping Control Committee has the power to reroute, nor yet do they
        take into consideration any of the tonnage under way or to be built in
        American shipyards, nor the 200,000 tons Japan has agreed to build for
        us as soon as we can deliver the plates; for this article deals only
        with conditions as they now exist.</p>

        <p>To sum up, the shipping situation, as disclosed by Government
        statistics, is far more satisfactory than current comment would lead
        one to believe. If it is not all we could wish, we have the
        satisfaction of knowing that Germany is much more dissatisfied with it
        than we are.</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>President Wilson signed the new selective draft bill on May 20,
            and issued a proclamation designating June 5 as the day when all
            young men who had reached the age of 21 since June 5, 1917, should
            register. Figures given out by the War Department on June 15
            indicated that 744,865 men had responded. On May 23, Major Gen.
            Crowder announced that an amendment to the law, compelling men not
            engaged in a useful occupation either to apply themselves to some
            form of labor contributing to the general good, or to enter the
            army, would become effective July 1.</p>

            <p>On May 27 President Wilson addressed the Congress urging the
            enactment of a new revenue bill during the present session.
            Hearings were begun at once by the House Committee on Ways and
            Means.</p>

            <p>The German Government on April 20 offered to free Siegfried Paul
            London, an alleged American, held in custody by the Germans in
            Warsaw, in exchange for the release of Captain Franz von Rintelen,
            and threatened reprisals against Americans in Germany in case the
            offer was refused. Secretary Lansing, on June 4, sent a reply
            through the Swiss Minister, flatly refusing to comply with the
            demand, and indicated that if reprisals were undertaken the United
            States would retaliate.</p>

            <p>Indictments charging conspiracy to commit treason against the
            United States and to commit espionage were returned on June 7
            against Jeremiah A. O'Leary, John T. Ryan, Willard Robinson, Emil
            Kipper, Albert Paul Fricke, Lieutenant Commander Hermann Wessels,
            and the Baroness Maria von Kretschmann, reported to be a kinswoman
            of the German Empress. Dr. Hugo Schweitzer and Rudolph Binder, now
            dead, were also named in the indictment. O'Leary, who had fled from
            justice after being indicted for conspiracy in connection with the
            publication of The Bull, was taken into custody in Washington on
            June 12.</p>

            <p>General Peyton C. March announced on June 15 that over 800,000

            <p>A supplementary note from the Netherlands Government was
            delivered to the State Department on May 22, contending that
            Secretary Lansing's reply to the original protest against the
            seizure by the United States Government of Dutch merchant shipping
            in American ports did not fully answer the objections.</p>

            <h3><a id="SUBMARINE_BLOCKADE" name=
            "SUBMARINE_BLOCKADE"></a>SUBMARINE BLOCKADE</h3>

            <p>German submarines began to raid shipping off the eastern coast
            of the United States on May 25. On June 3 it became known that
            twelve ships had been sunk. They were the schooners Hattie W. Dunn,
            the Edward H. Cole, the Edward Baird, the Isabel B. Wiley, the
            Samuel C. Mengel, the Samuel W. Hathaway, and the auxiliary
            schooner Hauppauge, and the steamships Texel, Winneconne, and the
            Carolina. Twelve lives were lost on the Carolina. The schooner
            Edward was attacked, but was saved and towed to port. Mines were
            set afloat by the submarines, and the tanker Herbert L. Pratt
            struck a mine off the Delaware Capes, but was raised and saved.
            Precautions were taken at once to guard against air raids on New
            York City and other places near the coast.</p>

            <p>On June 4 the Norwegian steamship Eibsvord was sunk off the
            Virginia Capes, and an American destroyer interrupted an attack on
            the French steamer Radioleine about sixty-five miles off the
            Atlantic Coast.</p>

            <p>The British steamer Harpathian was sunk off the Virginia Capes
            without warning on June 6, and the next day the Norwegian steamer
            Vinland was sunk in the same area.</p>

            <p>On June 9 the American steamer Pinar del Rio was sunk

        <p class="center">By a Correspondent at the Front</p>

        <p class="center">[By arrangement with The London Chronicle]</p>

        <p>The night mists came creeping up like a smoke screen, and the
        battalion that marched up toward the edge of the battlefield along the
        road that skirted the far end of the aerodrome was a regiment of shadow
        forms. A band of drums and fifes was playing them out with a merry
        little tune, so whimsical and yet so sad also in the heart of it.</p>

        <p>It had been decided that an important railway junction behind the
        German lines was to be bombed. All day long had been the continuous
        roar of death, and now, when night had fallen, all the sky seemed on
        fire with it. Voluminous clouds, all bright with a glory of infernal
        fire, rolled up to the sky, the most frightful and tragic thing it has
        ever been given to men to behold, with an infernal splendor beyond
        words to tell.</p>

        <p>With a tense, restless emotion the order to set off out over the
        enemy lines was awaited. In the ground-fog the machine, with a load of
        bombs tucked away under the wings, looked a mysterious, weird thing,
        and shadowy forms flitted hither and thither across the aerodrome. The
        tramp of marching men could be heard, and the tap of drums to the
        rhythm of their feet, and those transport columns which shake the
        Flemish cottages of the little hamlets as they pass along.</p>

        <p>At last the order was given, and up into the chill air the machine
        rose. Circling round a couple of times, the nose of the airplane was
        set in the direction of the objective, away behind the inferno of the
        hell-fires of No Man's Land.</p>

        <p>Only the mighty voice of the engine could be heard, and headlights
        were switched off just before crossing the line. There was still a
        dank, heavy mist hanging over the ground, and visibility was not so
        good as might have been desired.</p>

        <p>But down below one of those terrible bombardments, a beautiful and
        devilish thing, was in full blast. All the sky seemed on fire with it,
        and thousands of gun flashes were winking and blinking from hidden
        places and hollows. Shells rushed through the air as though flocks of
        colossal birds were in flight. Amid all the noise and din of those
        fires of hate and hell it was certain the monotonous drone of the
        engine would not be heard.</p>

        <p>Then, when the Hun lines had been crossed without trouble from
        "Archies," glancing back, star-shells could be seen bursting and
        pouring down golden rain. And as far as the eye could see, northward
        and southward, stretched seemingly unbroken lines of Verey lights. The
        enemy was also sending up his flares, as he often does, to reveal any
        masses of men who may be moving between his shell craters and ours.</p>

        <p>Quickly the "eggs" were dropped on the objective, and two terrific
        bursts of flame indicated the explosions. Evading the beams of a
        searchlight that sought to pick up the machine, home and the friendly
        darkness were sought.</p>

        <p>The German lines were recrossed, and, glancing below, it was seen
        that S O S light signals, with their little cries of color to the
        German gunners behind, were being sent up into the skies. It was some
        time ago that such lights were first seen up in the sky, and they had
        never ceased their winking for a single night, though now they appeared
        blurred in the white breath which had arisen from the wet earth.</p>

        <p>And to pass over all this is to conceive a great admiration for
        these gunners, who, amid all the tumult, deafening and nerve splitting,
        of our batteries, work with an endurance and courage to the limit of
        human nature. G. B.</p>

        <p class="center" style="font-weight: bold">Achievements of General
        Pershing's Troops in the Terrific Battles in Champagne and Picardy</p>

        <p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Month Ended June 18,
        1918</span>]</p>

        <p>With over 800,000 American troops in France, as the Secretary of War
        announced on June 15, 1918, the United States in the last month has
        assumed a far greater portion of the Allies' burden and has begun to
        take its full share in the large-scale fighting on the western front.
        Within a year since the first American troops landed in France, a
        period primarily one of preparation, the United States Army has
        developed into an important military factor. Evidence of this was seen
        in June in several engagements in which the Americans distinguished
        themselves by their gallantry, resourcefulness, and efficient methods.
        Prominent in the month's record were the American offensive at
        Cantigny, and later, on a much larger scale, the operations at
        Château-Thierry and in the Marne region near that town.</p>

        <p>General Pershing directed the offensive which resulted in the
        capture of the strongly fortified village of Cantigny, northwest of
        Montdidier, thereby creating a small salient. The attack, which was
        delivered on May 28, was on a front of one and one-quarter miles. The
        Americans, supported by French heavy guns in addition to their own
        artillery and French tanks, swept forward with remarkable speed and
        precision, occupied the village, captured 200 prisoners, and inflicted
        severe losses in killed and wounded on the enemy. Then, with equal
        rapidity, they consolidated their newly won positions and were thus
        able to repulse some very fierce counterattacks during the following
        days. The American casualties were relatively small. The troops that
        captured Cantigny were sent to that sector a month previously, after
        Pershing's offer to place all his men and resources at the disposal of
        the Allies. During the four weeks preceding the offensive the Americans
        had held their positions under comparatively heavy shelling.</p>

        <p>Both before and after the Cantigny engagement, the Americans in all
        the sectors where they held positions were occupied in ceaseless
        fighting of minor importance. There were many artillery duels, with
        plentiful use of gas on both sides, many raids, and considerable aerial
        activity. The Americans began to feel the effect of increased aircraft
        production, and in several sectors where the Germans had previously had
        the advantage the situation was now reversed and American aviators had
        the upper hand.</p>

        <h3>AT CHATEAU-THIERRY</h3>

        <p>Château-Thierry, a town on the Marne, was the next place where the
        Americans distinguished themselves. On May 31, when the capture of the
        town by the Germans was imminent, American machine gunners began to
        arrive on the river banks. Joining a battalion of French colonial
        troops, they entered the town, and by their well-organized defense
        positions and accurate fire, caused the advancing Germans to hesitate
        and halt. The Americans not only repulsed the Germans at every point at
        which they were engaged, but took prisoners without having any
        prisoners in turn taken by the Germans. The Americans in this sector
        were units drawn from the Marine Corps.</p>

        <p>The successful resistance against the Germans at Château-Thierry was
        followed by the marines beating off two determined German attacks on
        the Marne. The Germans concentrated large forces before Veuilly Wood,
        and began a mass attack. They were mowed downc by the<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_56" name="Page_56">[Pg 56]</a></span> American
        machine gunners, and the attack was broken up before reaching the
        American line. The Germans fled in confusion and with heavy losses.</p>

        <p>It was now the Americans' turn to attack. The marines, pushing
        forward on the morning of June 6, penetrated to a depth of over two
        miles on a front of two and a half miles, and occupied all the
        important high ground northwest of Château-Thierry. The French
        co-operated to the left of the Americans. The Germans were so hard
        pressed by the Americans that in three days it was necessary to bring
        up three new divisions of the best German troops.</p>

        <p>The Americans continued to advance, pushing forward to a line which
        lay through Les Mares Farm, just north of the village of Lucy le
        Bocage, and on through the outskirts of the town of Triangle. This line
        included strong positions in Bussiares Wood, the crossroads south of
        Torcy, and the southern edge of Belleau Wood. During the night of June
        6 the fighting raged with great fierceness for five hours. The
        Americans captured Bouresches and Torcy. Further fighting on June 7
        extended the American line over a front of about six miles to a depth
        of nearly two and a half miles. While the losses of the Americans were
        necessarily heavy, the German dead were piled three deep in places.</p>

        <p>The importance of the operations of the Americans on the Marne
        sector was evident from the fact that the day before they arrived on
        the front and began fighting, the Germans advanced about six miles.
        While the Americans advanced their line, the French completed the
        capture of Vilny, Veuilly-la-Poterie, and the heights southeast of
        Hautevesnes.</p>

        <h3>BELLEAU WOOD ENGAGEMENT</h3>

        <p>Following the capture of Bouresches came the fierce fighting for the
        possession of Belleau Wood to the north. This wooded hill was a
        stronghold of German infantry and machine gunners, and the only way to
        attack it was by advancing to the other side. The American infantry had
        the assistance of the artillery in clearing the wooded heights, and in
        the biggest artillery engagement in which the Americans had yet been
        engaged more than 5,000 high explosive and gas shells were thrown into
        the German machine gun nests in the woods. Meanwhile German attacks
        against Hill 204, west of Château-Thierry and commanding the town, were
        repulsed.</p>

        <p>The United States marines attacked again on the morning of June 10
        and penetrated the German lines for about two-thirds of a mile on a
        600-yard front in Belleau Wood, with the result that the Germans were
        driven from all but the northern fringe of the wood. On June 11 the
        wood was captured and 300 prisoners were taken.</p>

        <h3>FIRST FIELD ARMY</h3>

        <p>The War Department received reports on May 21 which showed that the
        first of the field armies had been organized and was in service in
        France. The army, composed of two army corps, each made up of one
        regular army, one National Guard, and one National Army division, was
        placed under the temporary command of Major Gen. Hunter Liggett, the
        senior Major General then in foreign service. General Liggett was
        selected to command the first army corps organized in France, and this
        corps, with that temporarily commanded by Major Gen. Charles T.
        Menoher, made up the first field army, the total strength of which was
        almost 200,000 men. By June 14 the American forces in France had become
        so numerous that General Foch had informed General Pershing that it was
        desirable to maintain them as purely American units. This fact was
        communicated to the House Military Affairs Committee by the War Council
        at Washington. In accordance with this policy two full American
        divisions were engaged in the fighting in the Château-Thierry sector.
        The Secretary of War told the committee that General Foch was gradually
        decreasing the number of Americans brigaded with the French and
        British, and thereby increasing the American unit.</p>

        <p>Official announcements made at Washington showed that approximately
        half a million soldiers had landed in France<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_57" name="Page_57">[Pg 57]</a></span> since the
        German drive began on March 21, 1918, and that Americans held no more
        than fifty miles of the whole western front. One element of Pershing's
        mobile forces, by direction of General Foch, guarded the way at the
        apex of the whole German wedge near Montdidier. Cantigny, which was
        captured by these forces, was very close to the point of maximum
        penetration achieved by the enemy after nearly three months of
        desperate fighting.</p>

        <p>The total casualties sustained by the American Expeditionary Forces
        from the beginning of American participation in the war up to June 17,
        1918, is shown in the following figures issued by the War Department at

        <h3>Capture of Cantigny by General Pershing's Troops Described in Vivid
        Detail</h3>

        <p class="center">By THOMAS M. JOHNSON</p>

        <p class="center" style="font-style: italic">Correspondent with the
        American Army</p>

        <p><i>This stirring narrative of the first attack and capture of enemy
        territory by the American forces in France was written by a staff
        correspondent of The New York Evening Sun. It constitutes a memorable
        chapter in our military history, not because of the size of the town
        captured, but because the event marks the beginning of offensive
        operations in Europe by the United States Army. The brave men who took
        Cantigny—at the apex of the German salient aimed at Amiens—continued to
        hold it against all counterattacks through the succeeding weeks. Under
        date of May 29, 1918, Mr. Johnson cabled from the front</i>:</p>

        <p>The Americans have made their first real attack of the war, and it
        is a complete success. Advancing up a wooded slope behind French tanks
        and protected by a perfect and annihilating barrage from French and
        American guns, our infantry at 7 o'clock Tuesday morning, May 28,
        stormed and captured the village of Cantigny, northwest of Montdidier,
        and the German defenses to the north and south, making an advance of a
        mile on a two-mile front.</p>

        <p>The Americans went over in open formation at 6:45 o'clock, advancing
        at an easy walk and maintaining intervals as if on parade. The sun had
        just risen, and through streaky clouds all about tongues of red flame
        were darting from the muzzles of hundreds of massed guns, big and
        small, while the air itself quivered with the shock of explosions,
        mingled with the deafening yet purring roar that is called drum
        fire.</p>

        <p>Cantigny itself was turned into a veritable hell, a pillar of fire
        and smoke, and into it went the crawling, sinister tanks followed by
        the American infantry in thin lines or little groups. For a while they
        were swallowed up in the great white and brown and black cloud that
        enveloped the village, then back to the American line came the first
        message: "We're here! Everything O. K.!"</p>

        <p>Thus these troops of the New World made their first real entry into
        the war. Thus they did what they could to help in offsetting the new
        German effort. Compared with the giant struggle going<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_58" name="Page_58">[Pg 58]</a></span> on
        elsewhere it was just a little outburst, but we did our best with it
        and have succeeded.</p>

        <h3>AN UNFORGETTABLE SCENE</h3>

        <p>No one who had the privilege to be on the scene at the time of this
        first American attack will ever forget the sight. It was unforgettable.
        The whole thing is uneffaceable from the time in the pregnant darkness
        when the troops that had been chosen for this most honorable of tasks
        went quietly along the shell-pitted roads to the jumping-off place;
        from the time the grotesque monsters called tanks rumbled up the same
        roads to hide until dawn in lairs behind the front line, while other
        monsters with long snouts crouched upon their heavy carriages like
        coiled serpents and were given their last drop of oil and their last
        daub of grease to make sure that their devastating charges would fall
        true upon their mark; from the time the men were given their last
        orders and their last "good luck" and went off, they knew not to what,
        in the first early streak of rosy dawn when the cannonade began and the
        first airplanes whirred overhead toward the doomed village.</p>

        <p>From then until that last throbbing hour when the tempest of
        shellfire drowned out everything, yes, up to that tense minute at 6:45
        o'clock when we turned to one another and in an awestruck whisper said,
        "They're over," it is all unforgettable. One lives such moments but
        once.</p>

        <p>This operation had been planned for weeks down to the minutest
        detail under the direction of the Superior French Command, and in the
        closest co-operation with the French, to whom must go a liberal measure
        of the credit for its success.</p>

        <p>So far as its objects may be disclosed, they were the following: To
        reduce the enemy salient and capture its strong point and observation
        post. Cantigny was all those things. Jutting out from the German front,
        it gave the enemy an advantage in the field of fire, while, because of
        its strong cellars, which were linked up with an especially long tunnel
        under the château in the southern part of the village, which might be
        likened to its citadel, it was decidedly a strong post.</p>

        <p>Perhaps most important of all, it gave the boche a local advantage
        comparable to that of a man looking down a well. It commanded a sort of
        valley running back into our lines and permitted the enemy observers to
        see many things that went on there and so direct his artillery fire
        upon our back areas. For all of those reasons Cantigny was a prize of
        value out of all proportion to its size.</p>

        <h3>ATTACK CAREFULLY REHEARSED</h3>

        <p>The attack was carefully planned and was rehearsed by our infantry
        with tanks. They had the further advantage of valuable data gained by
        our patrols in frequent night explorations of the village, whence the
        boche seems to have withdrawn his infantry during darkness.</p>

        <p>To two American soldiers goes the credit for the fine and loyal
        thing they did which immeasurably contributed to the success of their
        comrades. These two soldiers were captured early yesterday morning in a
        trench raid, and last night the question on every one's mind was, "did
        they tell?" They knew what was coming and had rehearsed it. Subjected
        to Prussian grilling, would they tell? The answer came this morning.
        The Germans were caught completely by surprise just as they made
        relief. The prisoners taken by us included some incoming and some
        outgoing troops. They hadn't the slightest idea the attack was coming.
        They didn't tell, those boys of ours. All the more honor to them for
        it!</p>

        <h3>PLAN OF THE ATTACK</h3>

        <p>This is how the attack was executed: The troops selected to make it
        entered the trenches in two shifts, the first on Sunday night and the
        second on Monday night, May 27. Special trenches had been constructed
        to accommodate a larger number of men than usual. Two hours before
        zero—that is to say, at 4:45 o'clock this morning—the men withdrew to
        supporting trenches, whence they went to the front line at zero, or
        6:45.</p>

            <div class="caption">
                CANTIGNY, THE FIRST TOWN CAPTURED IN FRANCE BY AMERICAN TROOP
            </div>
        </div>

        <p>They were divided into three waves for the main attack, with
        separate detachments to whom had been allotted the task of mopping up
        the Cantigny cellars. On the right and centre the advance was made to
        the furthest objectives, while on the left, according to the plan,
        after mopping up the German trenches, our troops withdrew slightly to a
        better position, connecting with our old front line.</p>

        <p>The troops went forward in extended order, preceded by the powerful
        tanks, all of which entered Cantigny and went some distance beyond.
        With the infantry went a detachment of flame throwers who were used
        against the cellars when the boche refused to come out when ordered to
        do so. They were also accompanied by a strong detachment of engineers,
        signal corps men, and carrier pigeons, but the wires have remained
        intact.</p>

        <p>The artillery fire was tremendous. The German batteries at the rear
        were also drenched by gas. A rolling barrage behind which the infantry
        advanced was laid by the field guns. The infantry went forward first at
        the rate of fifty yards per minute and then at twenty-five yards per
        minute. The moving barrage of fire stalked ahead of our men into
        Cantigny, keeping the boche down until the infantry was upon him.</p>

        <p>The timetable was adhered to perfectly. At 4:45 o'clock the
        artillery began a heavy concentrated fire, swelling to a drum fire at
        6:45, "zero," continuing thence onward to 7:20, when the infantry
        reached their final objectives. At 7:30 the infantry outlined their
        position with flares so as to enable the airplanes to signal back. Thus
        it will be seen that Cantigny was taken in less than thirty-five
        minutes, for the final objectives were beyond the village.</p>

        <h3>ALL MODERN WEAPONS USED</h3>

        <p>There were some tough nuts to crack besides Cantigny itself, such as
        the trench system protecting it on the south, also part of the Fontaine
        Wood, and some separate houses at the crossroads at the southeastern
        outskirts of the town, but all were reduced with bombs, bayonets, or
        rifles, while the machine guns which went along with the infantry also
        aided.</p>

        <p>Besides all this, a heavy smoke barrage was used, not only to screen
        our infantry from boche observers, but to blind the boche gunners. The
        tremendous effectiveness of the whole thing was<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_60" name="Page_60">[Pg 60]</a></span> shown by
        the fact that for nearly a half hour after the infantry went over the
        top, the German artillery was practically silenced. This was due
        especially to the accurate counterbattery work of the French
        heavies.</p>

        <p>So the Americans in their first attack had the aid of every engine
        of modern warfare—tanks, gas, flame throwers, smoke barrage, numbers of
        airplanes, machine guns and automatic rifles, while some especially
        heavy trench mortars also were concentrated and hurled great bombs into
        the German trenches from close range. Reports all agree that the German
        defenses were completely leveled, and the smashed up trenches look like
        a field plowed by a giant harrow. Our men walked into the trenches
        through great gaps torn in the barbed wire, but in many places there
        was no wire at all for great stretches. So much for the main outlines
        of the attack.</p>

        <h3>WATCHING THE BEGINNINGS</h3>

        <p>Waking up early in the morning on the blanket bed on the floor of
        the dugout and taking a first peek through the sandbagged entrance, it
        was plain that our best hopes were going to be realized and that it
        would be a clear day with good visibility. The sun had not yet
        appeared, but the clouds were few and the early light showed every
        feature of the country. Here and there were dark dots denoting the
        waiting batteries, while sausage balloons were already swinging
        overhead.</p>

        <p>In the messroom the commanding General sat at breakfast, cleanly
        shaven and unworried, although he had been on the front line most of
        the night. This General, who was in immediate command, talked not about
        the attack, but about the censorship, tactfully choosing the favorite
        subject of every correspondent.</p>

        <p>By this time the artillery had started, so we went out along the
        road toward the front, passing a line of ambulances parked under the
        trees. The further we went along the road the more frequent became the
        flashes of the explosions on either side, but thus far not a single
        boche shell had come in and the sounds overhead were all caused by the
        familiar rushing of our shells and none by the whistle of the boche
        shells.</p>

        <p>Some distance up the road was a vantage spot whence we got a clear
        view of Cantigny, or the spot where it had been. It was a picture
        terrible in its grandeur. Cantigny might have been a volcano in
        eruption shooting up clouds that were first white, then brown, then
        black, while above the air was filled with spiral shaped black clouds
        of exploding shrapnel.</p>

        <h3>GUNNERS BEAT THEIR RECORD</h3>

        <p>That great smoke cloud was eternally writhing and twisting and
        taking on new forms as if anguished Cantigny were trying to escape its
        fate, but every instant more guns flashed. Beside the observation post
        the cloud grew larger. Finally the smoke streamed off to the right.
        Near by the American gunners were working, stripped to their
        undershirts, dripping with perspiration. We walked over there.</p>

        <p>"This is the fastest firing we've ever done," said one breathless
        officer.</p>

        <p>Further to the right was the house where the correspondent spent
        several days and nights a month ago. It is ruined now, but batteries
        are still there, and they, too, were spouting fire and smoke.</p>

        <p>To the left new batteries had opened and the din was terrific. It
        was hard to resist the impulse to put one's fingers in one's ears. A
        glance at the watch showed that it lacked barely five minutes of the
        "zero" hour. Those five minutes passed more rapidly, and yet more
        slowly, than any I had ever experienced.</p>

        <p>Ahead was a green slope dotted with trees, up which our infantry was
        to advance. It was bare and empty. It seemed incredible that in a few
        minutes our men would be there. The second hand crawled, yet raced,
        around the dial. It rested on the figure 10 and we looked at one
        another. "They're over," we whispered.</p>

        <p>We looked up from our watches to find that the smoke clouds had
        drifted down the slope until the whole country for miles about Cantigny
        was obscured<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_61" name="Page_61">[Pg
        61]</a></span> by shifting, changing vapor from the great caldron
        toward which our unseen men were plunging. We almost groaned our
        disappointment, for in a moment there came a little rift in the smoke,
        revealing something moving on the ground.</p>

        <p>Imagine looking at the teeth of a black comb through a wire screen
        and having some one pass the comb slowly before your eyes. That was
        what it looked like—those black teeth, our men, were screened by the
        shifting smoke. It was only the tiniest glimpse. Then the smoke drifted
        over and rose again, but we had seen them going forward and upward to
        Cantigny. After a time the smoke spread still further. Nothing remained
        to be seen.</p>

        <h3>ALL WENT AS REHEARSED</h3>

        <p>Walking back along the road, where now there were a few belated
        boche shells coming, the heavy artillery officer said: "From my
        observation post we could see them for a couple of minutes. They went
        just the way they rehearsed, just walked along slowly, keeping in fine
        alignment. We could see two of the three waves and not a single man out
        of place, following the barrage like veterans. We could even see an
        individual man sometimes."</p>

        <p>Beside the road ambulances were waiting. From overhead an observer
        came sweeping down to drop a message near a white marker on the ground.
        He leaned out of his seat and waved his hand; then the machine soared
        up again. Evidently all was going well. Other planes were hovering over
        Cantigny.</p>

        <p>As we entered headquarters all about the guns were crashing and
        flashing. Headquarters was an underground hive swarming with activity.
        Officers were hugging telephones or were bent over maps under electric
        lights. Some were in khaki and some were in light blue. The first of
        these latter was Lieut. Col. de Chambrun, a descendant of Lafayette.
        "It goes well," he said, and a moment later an American officer called
        from a telephone: "They can see the boche throwing down his arms in
        Cantigny." After that the messages came thick and fast:</p>

        <p>"The first boche shell hit our front line at 7:06—the Colonel has
        twenty prisoners—the right flank is sending back about a
        hundred—balloon reports grenade fighting west of Cantigny where our men
        are mopping up the trenches—two of our stretcher bearers are returning
        with an empty stretcher—one tank returning from Cantigny—our men are
        seen walking around the street of Cantigny—flame throwers can be seen
        through the smoke clearing out the dug-outs—enemy fire beginning on
        Cantigny Wood at 7:30, three-quarters of an hour after zero."</p>

        <p>After that come other reports of German batteries at last able to
        operate, though haltingly. Shortly afterward the officer reported,
        laconically, "There goes my observation post. Steve's gone to capture
        Cantigny single-handed. Couldn't keep him there."</p>

        <p>The French and Americans were jubilant. There were mutual
        handshakings, then silence, and in came a grimy, sweaty, but happy
        soldier, the first of the men who'd been over the top into Cantigny. He
        saluted punctiliously: "Sir, I have brought back twenty prisoners."</p>

        <h3>PEN READY FOR PRISONERS</h3>

        <p>Sure enough, there they were outside, about to be herded into a
        detention pen that was already prepared for them. They were
        dull-looking men, still half stunned, in dirt-gray uniforms, looking
        like slugs or earthworms, sullen and angry at being captured by
        Americans. The officer said 120 had been counted up above already, and
        added: "Hope we get enough to even up for Seicheprey."</p>

        <p>The soldier was triumphant. "I went with the first wave," he said.
        "We got to a sort of trench, and all of a sudden the boches jumped
        right up in front of us and started to throw grenades. We went at 'em
        with grenades, bayonets, rifles, pistols, whatever came handy. I
        spitted one big fellow on my bayonet, but the bayonet stuck. So I
        pulled out my trench knife and went for another, but he yelled
        'Kamerad!' so I grabbed his gun and hit a third over the head with it.
        There were grenades busting all around, but I<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_62" name="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span> could hear
        our fellows shouting 'Go to it, Yanks!' the same as they did all the
        way over No Man's Land.</p>

        <p>"Pretty quick all the boches were yelling 'Kamerad!' and putting up
        their hands. The Captain told me to herd these together and get them
        down quick so they could be questioned. There's about a hundred more up
        in the woods cut off by the barrage."</p>

        <p>A little later the wounded began coming back to the dressing
        stations which had been specially prepared. The wounded were all
        cheerful, saying, "We went right through 'em—nothing to it—go back and
        do it again tomorrow." Every man asked only two things: "How many
        boches did we get?" and "Have you got a cigarette?"</p>

        <p>These are the real victors of Cantigny. When all's said and done,
        the staff may plan, guns may fire, tanks may crawl, but the common
        infantry soldier is the real hero of all.</p>

        "Americans_Defense_of_Chateau-Thierry"></a>Americans' Defense of
        Château-Thierry</h2>

        <p>United States troops, mostly inexperienced in actual warfare, on
        June 1 played a brilliant part in the defense of Château-Thierry. By
        their prompt and resolute support to the French they assisted in
        driving the Germans from the south bank of the Marne at that vital
        point, and were largely responsible for blocking the enemy's determined
        advance across the river toward Paris, thus preventing the development
        of a most serious situation for the Allies. The French official report
        of the incident was as follows:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>American troops checked German advanced forces which were
            seeking to penetrate Neuilly Wood, and by a magnificent
            counterattack hurled back the Germans north this wood.</p>

            <p>Further south the Germans were not able to make any gains. On
            the Marne front an enemy battalion which had crept across to the
            left bank of the river above Jaulgonne was counterattacked by
            French and American troops and hurled back to the other bank, after
            having suffered heavy losses. A footbridge which the enemy used was
            destroyed and 100 prisoners remained in our hands.</p>

        <h3>A BRITISH ACCOUNT</h3>

        <p>The Reuter correspondent under date of June 5 described the feat of
        the Americans at Château-Thierry in these words:</p>

        <blockquote>
            <p>On May 31, when the Germans were already in the outskirts of
            Château-Thierry, an American machine-gun unit was hurried thither
            in motor lorries. Château-Thierry lies on both banks of the Marne,
            which is spanned by a big bridge. A little to the northward a canal
            runs parallel to the river and is crossed by a smaller bridge.</p>

            <p>The Americans had scarcely reached their quarters when news was
            received that the Germans had broken into the northern part of
            Château-Thierry, having made their way through the gap they had
            driven in our lines to the left of the town and then pouring along
            the streets to the bridge, intending to establish themselves firmly
            on the south bank and capture the town.</p>

            <p>The American machine gunners and French colonials were thrown
            into Château-Thierry together. The Americans immediately took over
            the defense of the river bank, especially the approaches to the
            bridge. Fighting with their habitual courage and using their guns
            with an accuracy which won the highest encomiums from the French,
            they brought the enemy to a standstill.</p>

            <p>Already wavering under the American fire, the Germans were
            counterattacked by the French colonials and driven from the town.
            They returned to the attack the next night and under cover of
            darkness crept into the town along the river bank and began to work
            their way through the streets toward the main bridge. At the same
            moment a tremendous artillery bombardment was opened upon the
            southern half of the town.</p>
        </blockquote>

     <h3>BLOWING UP THE BRIDGE</h3>

     <blockquote>
        <p>When within range of the machine guns the Germans advanced under the
        cover of clouds of thick white smoke from smoke bombs, in order to
        baffle the aim of the American gunners. A surprise, however, was in
        store for them. They were already crossing the bridge, evidently
        believing themselves masters of both banks, when a thunderous explosion
        blew the centre of the bridge and a number of Germans with it into the
        river. Those who reached the southern bank were immediately
        captured.</p>

        <p>In this battle in the streets, and again at night, the young
        American soldiers<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_63" name=
        "Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span> showed a courage and determination which
        aroused the admiration of their French colonial comrades. With their
        machine guns they covered the withdrawal of troops across the bridge
        before its destruction, and although under severe fire themselves, kept
        all the approaches to the bank under a rain of bullets which nullified
        all the subsequent efforts of the enemy to cross the river. Every
        attempt of the Germans to elude the vigilance of the Americans resulted
        in disaster.</p>

        <p>During the last two days the enemy has renounced the occupation of
        the northern part of Château-Thierry, which the American machine guns
        have made untenable. It now belongs to No Man's Land, as, since the
        destruction of the bridges, it is not worth while for the French to
        garrison it.</p>

        <p>Against their casualties the Americans can set a much greater loss
        inflicted by their bullets on the enemy. They have borne their full
        part in what a French staff officer well qualified to judge described
        as one of the finest feats of the war.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>THE QUICK ADVANCE</h3>

    <p>The story of the quick advance of the American marines was related in
    detail by Wilbur Forrest in The New York Tribune as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It is a narrative that stands for more, perhaps, than most of those
        written in American history books. It is literally another story of
        American minute men who abandoned the figurative plowshares of peaceful
        training camps and rushed to the scene of action. They met the enemy
        with weapons they knew how to handle.</p>

        <p>On May 30 the enemy reached the Marne east of Château-Thierry and
        began a forceful advance along the north bank toward the city. The same
        day American machine gunners received orders 100 kilometers to the rear
        to jump into auto trucks and hurry into action.</p>

        <p>They started almost immediately, and an all-night journey found the
        battalion at 4 o'clock in the afternoon of the 31st on a hill
        overlooking Château-Thierry. All around them French batteries were
        firing full tilt. The enemy was advancing on the city.</p>

        <p>Right here those American machine gunners got their first glimpse of
        real war. German shells crashed into villages within plain view and the
        little city below them was not being spared. The officers chose a small
        nearby village as headquarters and the marines waited for darkness
        before loading little black machine guns on their shoulders and
        marching into Château-Thierry.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>GERMAN SHELLS RAKE CITY</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>German high explosives and shrapnel were raking the city, but the
        young Americans under fire for the first time coolly placed their guns
        in position on the south bank of the river. They saw heavy shells
        strike the railroad station and they saw it burn. They saw houses fall
        like packs of cards, and I have the word of a Frenchman, who was
        present, that they were "cool like American cucumbers."</p>

        <p>During the night the Germans gradually filtered into the outskirts
        on the north side of the town. Roughly speaking, the American guns were
        so placed between the houses and in the gardens as to enfilade the
        approaches to the bridges and the streets on the opposite sides. All
        remained on the south bank of the river with the exception of a
        Lieutenant, (John T. Bissell,) a youthful Pittsburgher, who was one of
        West Point's latest graduates.</p>

        <p>The Lieutenant with a dozen men and two guns was ordered to cross
        the river to prevent the enemy's advance along forked roads which merge
        to the right of the northern approach to the iron bridge. For
        convenience sake it is permissible to say that A Company was charged
        with holding the left part of the town on the south bank and the
        approaches to the larger bridges, while B Company's guns swept the
        opposite approaches to the iron bridge, and, therefore, held the right
        portion of the town.</p>

        <p>Several hundred yards separated the two companies. The enemy's
        shelling was intensified during the night, but no Germans were yet in
        sight. The machine guns were quiet, although A Company's commander, O.
        F. Houghton of Portland, Me., was forced to abandon the headquarters he
        had chosen in a house on the bank of the river and change the position
        of some guns because of the enemy's precise fire.</p>

        <p>It was a waiting game for Company A's guns. In the meantime Company
        B, at about 5 A. M., in broad daylight, saw two columns of the enemy of
        twelve men each, advancing across an open field toward the river to the
        right of their position. The Germans carried light machine guns and
        were blissfully ignorant that our men were here. One American gun swung
        its shy little nose around toward the Germans and waited. Behind it was
        an unpoetic youth named Must of Columbia, S. C., a Sergeant, who waited
        until he saw the whites of their eyes, and then let them have it, as he
        explained today.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>AT CLOSE RANGE</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"I got eight out of the bunch by a little surprise shooting," said
        the Sergeant with a considerable show of pride. "They flopped nicely.
        Then I turned on the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_64" name=
        "Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span> other squad, but they were leary and I
        only got one. The rest of them got into the ditch and crawled back
        without showing themselves. Later in the day their Red Cross men came
        out to pick up the wounded. We've got orders not to fire on members of
        the Red Cross, so I let 'em work unmolested. But I kept tally all day
        when their Red Cross men came out. By my count they carried off nine
        and they weren't all wounded, either."</p>

        <p>The Germans during the day of June 1 gained the hills overlooking
        the north bank of the river. Their machine guns and their artillery
        observers, therefore, were able to direct a galling fire on the south
        bank and portions of the north bank which still were held by French
        colonials and two machine guns under an American Lieutenant.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>DEADLY MACHINE GUNS</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The enemy's position thus made the north bank untenable and orders
        were given to retire to the south bank under cover of the darkness. At
        9:30 P. M. the French, in accordance with these plans, retired to the
        south bank and blew up a stone bridge. The American machine gun
        companies during the retirement poured a galling fire from the flanks
        into the areas evacuated by the retiring troops.</p>

        <p>The enemy was now shelling the south bank more heavily and the enemy
        machine-gun fire was multiplied. The commander of Company A was forced
        to change the position of his guns in order to secure a better field of
        fire. With the light Hotchkiss pieces on their shoulders he led his men
        into a wood further down the river. Here they were spotted by enemy
        observers and thirty high explosive shells crashed into the wood. The
        shelling ceased and the guns went into their positions.</p>

        <p>The French were still retiring at 10:30 P. M. It was pitch dark,
        except for shell bursts and the streaky flame stabs from the machine
        guns on both sides—the Americans were in the wood and along the south
        bank of the river, the Germans on the crest of the hill on the other
        side.</p>

        <p>Suddenly there was an immense detonation. It was the big bridge
        blowing up. Then there came out of the darkness across the river, as
        the firing lulled, the ghostly chant of the advancing enemy. It was one
        of those German mass attacks, where men, shoulder to shoulder, singing
        inguttural tones the praise of Germany and the Kaiser, blindly walk
        into death like fanatics.</p>

        <p>The sort of creaky, shuffling sound their boots made as they trotted
        into the open road came across the river like the wailing of lost
        souls, converged toward the bridge and was heard by these young
        Americans, who strained their eyes across the river to get what
        machine-gun men call "the target." But it was in pitch darkness, and
        there was only the sound to tell them there were plenty of "targets."
        Every little black devil of a machine gun tore loose with hellfire. The
        Americans behind them, who saw their first glimpse of war about thirty
        hours before, fed in bullets as fast as human hands could work. And the
        bullets caught their "targets" on the opposite side.</p>

        <p>The "target" came on again and again, but nothing could live in that
        leaden hail. The enemy waves melted in the darkness.</p>

        <p>Now come the even more thrilling experiences of the little band of
        Americans under Lieutenant Bissell who had been cut off and surrounded
        by the enemy across the river. Even experienced soldiers could not be
        blamed if they had surrendered there.</p>

        <p>At the beginning of the German mass attack a few French colonial
        soldiers, also cut off by the blown-up bridge, made the Lieutenant
        understand that then it was every man for himself. The north bank was
        becoming a seething mass of Germans. All other forces had retired
        across the river. Bullets were registering on every foot of the space
        approaching the bridges.</p>

        <p>The Germans chant to keep up the courage of the advancing masses.
        They sometimes yell to disconcert their enemies. With this ghostly
        chanting drawing nearer to the Lieutenant and his men and the weird
        yells of the Germans occasionally splitting the night, there was no
        thought of surrender. Their orders were to retreat by the main bridge,
        and orders were orders.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>SERIOUS PREDICAMENT</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Picking up both guns, each man carrying his allotted piece in
        manoeuvres, the party of thirteen started along the river for the main
        bridge. Reaching the vicinity of the approach, they discovered their
        plight. The enemy was almost upon them. Still carrying their guns, they
        jumped down, taking cover under the stone parapets at the river's edge.
        Thus they worked their way down to the iron bridge, though the Germans
        on the very parapet above were marching into a hail of American machine
        guns from the south bank.</p>

        <p>B Company did not know that a detachment had not escaped. The German
        attack remained at its height, and the enemy, despite its losses, kept
        sweeping toward the iron bridge. Bissell and his men attempted to cross
        under their own fire. Three were immediately wounded. They retired,
        picking up their wounded.</p>

        <p>The Lieutenant knew that B Company's guns were across the bridge,
        and he approached as near as he dared and yelled<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_65" name="Page_65">[Pg 65]</a></span> repeatedly.
        B Company's officers finished the story, which was narrated and
        corroborated by the Lieutenant and others at the rest camp today.</p>

        <p>The first B Company knew that Americans were opposite was when they
        heard a voice calling "Cobey! Cobey!" Cobey was the other
        Lieutenant.</p>

        <p>This time the German attack melted. B Company's guns ceased fire
        long enough for Cobey to cross the bridge and lead the Lieutenant and
        the men to safety. Throughout the remainder of the night the enemy
        vented his rage by heavy shelling. The next day, June 2, the heavy
        shelling continued. The enemy had picked up his dead and wounded across
        the river under cover of darkness and could be seen occasionally
        flitting from house to house.</p>

        <p>Sniping was continuous between the French and Germans. Machine guns
        were silent during the day in order not to give away their positions.
        Nightfall was so quiet that the Americans were not able to understand
        such warfare. They thought all war was noisy.</p>

        <p>However, at 9 o'clock at night the enemy made a fierce rush for the
        iron bridge. Fifteen minutes of heavy machine-gun firing squelched the
        attack and the shelling was resumed. The heavy bombardment
        continued.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>"GOT" WHOLE PLATOON</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>On June 3 the Sergeant in charge of one of our platoons at the iron
        bridge saw a German platoon of about fifty men forming on top of a
        hill. They made a beautiful target, according to the Sergeant's story
        today. He and his companions believe he got them all.</p>

        <p>The enemy brought more artillery up by night and began a terrific
        shelling to culminate in what appeared to be an attempted attack. The
        French artillery sprinkled the opposite bank of the river with a
        barrage which the "novice" American fighters called beautiful. They
        thought it was less than a hundred yards away, and stood up to watch
        it, and there wasn't any attack.</p>

        <p>The French engineers on this night laid a charge under the iron
        bridge while the American guns laid down a leaden protective barrage.
        When the charge was detonated the Germans rushed forward from the house
        to ascertain the cause of the explosion. It was here that a prearranged
        petrol flare lit up the vicinity like day, and again American machine
        gunners had what they insist on calling "targets."</p>

        <p>"I was impressed by many things," a company's Captain said. "First
        of all, the coolness of every man, and especially of a young Georgia
        theological student who had been drafted, who on the third day
        complained because the boche shells kept mussing up his gun position.
        Second, the attitude of those wonderful French colonial troops with us.
        They gave us inspiration. They said we gave them inspiration; so it was
        a fifty-fifty exchange. Third, that beautiful French barrage and our
        wonderful 'targets.'"</p>

    Exploit of American Troops Northwest of Château-Thierry</h3>

    <p><i>The American troops achieved their most important exploit on June 6,
    7, and 8 in the region northwest of Château-Thierry. Here they drove back
    the Germans for nearly two miles along a front of several miles, took from
    them the important Belleau Wood, captured over 1,000 prisoners,
    successfully resisted and seriously demoralized two crack divisions of
    Prussians which had been picked especially to punish them, and effectively
    blocked a desperate attempt of the Germans to break through the line, an
    attempt which, if successful, would have given them an open road toward
    Paris and created a situation of extreme peril to the Allies. Edwin L.
    James, a correspondent of</i> <span class="smcap">The New York
    Times</span>, <i>described this achievement as follows</i>:</p>

    <p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Copyrighted</span>]</p>

    <p>There was considerable wonderment among French and American officers
    last week when it was discovered that the crack 5th Guard and 28th German
    Divisions were in front of us. It was generally believed then that the
    Germans planned no immediate attempt to advance northwest of
    Château-Thierry, and there was much speculation as to why Hindenburg had
    sent these troops there. This is now explained by a captured German
    officer's statement, and is substantiated by documents found on him. He
    said these two divisions already were on their way to the rear for a four
    weeks' rest, to take part in another offensive, when suddenly they were
    ordered to go at once to the front northwest of Château-Thierry, "in order
    to prevent at all costs the Americans being able to achieve success."</p>

        </div>
    </div>

    <p>This showed the anxiety of the German High Command regarding the effect
    that an American success would have on the German Army and the populace,
    and of the great desirability of preventing such a happening.</p>

    <h3>UNDERESTIMATED OUR EFFORT</h3>

    <p>When I visited the headquarters of this French army today [June 14] a
    sheet of paper was handed to me on which was written a report of
    information gained from the examination of a large number of prisoners from
    the 28th German Division. The report said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>American assistance, which was underestimated in Germany because
        they doubted its value and its opportunity worries the German High
        Command more than it will admit. The officers themselves recognize
        that, among other causes, it is the principal reason for which Germany
        hastens to try to end the war and impose peace. They believe that if we
        succeed in holding on for the rest of this year the German cause will
        be lost. But they say that until the end of the year they will allow us
        no respite in their effort to break our morale and our will to conquer.
        They hope that fear of devastations and the terror caused in Paris, as
        well as continuing attacks of the German Army, determined to end the
        war, will get the best of our resistance before American aid will
        become truly effective.</p>

        <p>All agree that the war is reaching the supreme crisis at this
        moment. They all declare that the offensives will be renewed and
        prolonged in view of this decision until the German forces are
        exhausted.</p>

        <p>In addition, the prisoners did not conceal their great surprise at
        the training and quickness that the Americans have shown against them,
        nor at the good work accomplished by the artillery, which for three
        days engaged them, cutting off all food supplies and all reinforcements
        and causing them very heavy losses—practically all of the officers and
        twenty-five of the men were killed or wounded in a single infantry
        company and twelve in a machine-gun section, of which the full quota
        was seventeen men.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Especially important is this report coming from the French Army, not
    because the Americans would emphasize such statements by prisoners, but
    because of the probability that the Germans<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_67" name="Page_67">[Pg 67]</a></span> might be rather praiseworthy of
    Americans when questioned by our officers with a view to getting better
    treatment as prisoners of war. There is no question that this document
    speaks the truth.</p>

    <p>A letter written by a German officer and found on his body said:</p>

    <p>"The Americans are so courageous that they do not allow themselves to be
    made prisoners." Another letter written by a German private called the
    Americans "devilhounds."</p>

    <h3>GERMANY FEARS AMERICA</h3>

    <p>Germany fears America, and that fear is growing. At first the High
    Command told their officers and the officers told the soldiers that the
    Americans could not get to France because the U-boats would stop them. Then
    the German fighters began to find Americans appearing against them here and
    there, and finally at many points. Then the officers told the German
    soldiers the Americans would not fight. Now the German soldiers know the
    Americans can and will fight; and more and more of them are learning it
    every day. There is no lack of evidence that the German populace fears
    America's power in the war, and no question that the German High Command is
    seriously perturbed at the results when the real news of the Americans'
    fighting gets back to the people.</p>

    <p>In no spirit of boastfulness it may be said that American fighters, with
    a proper amount of training, are the best fighters in France today. The
    soldiers of other armies of necessity are tired after nearly four years of
    fighting, but the Americans are fresh, fresh in spirit and physique. Other
    soldiers hope that Germany will be beaten; the American soldiers know that
    Germany will be beaten. And Germany knows that Germany will be beaten
    unless she wins in the next four months. That is her only chance, and she
    will play it for what it is worth. Everything is to be thrown into that
    effort. There will be ruthlessness, there will be frightfulness.</p>

    <p>The four days' victorious fight for possession of the important Bois de
    Belleau, northwest of Château-Thierry, resulted in the capture, besides the
    prisoners mentioned, of two German field guns, 77s, and thirty machine
    guns, besides some small mortars. This was the first capture of German
    artillery by Americans. I believe that when the history of the war is
    written the Americans' capture of the Bois de Belleau will be ranked among
    the neatest pieces of military work of the conflict.</p>

    <p>Five days ago, [June 9,] after the capture of the town of Bouresches,
    the Americans started the task of taking away the Bois de Belleau from the
    Germans. In the rush at Bouresches they had been unable to secure the rocky
    strongholds in the woods, and passed on, leaving many nests of machine guns
    there, which afterward kept up a harassing fire. The Americans several
    times made big raids into the woods, clearing out part of the Germans, but
    the next day the Germans would reappear with a harassing fire. Despite
    strong artillery work, the Germans seemed able to stay there.</p>

    <p>On Sunday, the 9th, a rain of extra heavy artillery fire began on the
    woods. This kept up all Sunday night and Monday. On Monday night the fire
    was redoubled and the woods literally raked with lines of shellfire.</p>

    <p>At about 3 o'clock Monday morning the marines started, as soon as the
    artillery fire was stopped, to go through those woods. At the nearer edge
    of the woods, devastated by our shellfire, they encountered little
    opposition. A little further on the Germans made a small stand, but were
    completely routed; that is, those who were not killed. By this time the
    marines were fairly started on their way. They swept forward, clearing out
    machine gun nests with rifle fire, bayonets, and hand grenades.</p>

    <h3>WORK OF MARINES</h3>

    <p>The Germans started in headlong flight when the Americans seized two
    machine guns and turned them on the Germans with terrific effect. The
    Germans soon tired of this, and those nearest the Americans began
    surrendering. In the meantime the marines kept up the chase.</p>

    </div>

    <p>While this was going on the Americans almost surrounded the woods, and
    the Germans, fleeing from some of the Americans, ran into the machine gun
    and rifle fire of the others. Then those left rushed headlong the other way
    to surrender. In a short time the gallant marines had got to the other side
    of the woods, and immediately, with the aid of the engineers, started the
    construction of a strong position.</p>

    <p>Prisoners counted that day numbered more than 300. It was found that
    they belonged to the crack 5th German Guard Division, which includes the
    Queen Elizabeth Regiment. There had been 1,200 Germans in the woods. With
    the exception of the prisoners nearly all the rest were slain.</p>

    <p>The prisoners said they were glad of the chance to surrender and get out
    of the woods, because the American artillery fire for three days had cut
    off their food and other supplies and they had lived in a hell on earth.
    The Germans seemed deeply impressed by the fury of the American attack. One
    of the captured officers, when asked what he thought of the Americans as
    fighters, answered that the artillery was crazy and the infantry drunk. A
    little German private, taking up his master's thought, pointed to three
    tousled but smiling marines, and said: "Vin rouge, vin blanc, beaucoup
    vin." He meant he thought the Americans must be intoxicated, to fight as
    they did for that wood.</p>

    <p>Our boys took especial delight in corralling the machine guns. These
    guns had been very well placed behind trees and in rocky caves and well
    supplied with ammunition. The Americans had practiced on a German machine
    gun previously captured, and knew just how to use them against the
    "Heinies." The captured guns were cleverly camouflaged and were almost
    overlooked by the Americans. The mortars had been used to throw gas shells
    from the heights into the woods upon the Americans.</p>

    <h3>GERMAN MORALE LOW</h3>

    <p>There was the greatest surprise among American officers at the evident
    low morale among members of the 5th Guard Division, thought to be one of
    the Kaiser's very best.</p>

    <p>The Germans had tried their best to get the Americans out of the wood
    and to hold the valuable position. They had sent attack after attack there,
    always failing to gain complete free possession, but making things very
    unpleasant for our men. It was after four days of this that the marines got
    on their hind legs and went after the Germans.</p>

    <p>An American General tonight characterized the capture of Belleau Wood as
    the most important thing the Americans at the front had yet accomplished.
    Its possession straightens our line, taking away from the German his
    protected wedge into our positions, and gives an excellent starting point
    for further operations.</p>

    <p>Two hours after the Americans started through the wood the Germans
    launched their heavy attack to regain Bouresches. A dark and cloudy night
    had aided their preparations for the rush, but the Americans, expecting
    something of the sort, had the northern side of the town lined with machine
    guns, and had artillery all trained on the railroad embankment
    over<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_69" name="Page_69">[Pg 69]</a></span>
    which the Germans had to come. The Americans seem to have excellent tab on
    the German movements, and when, at 5 o'clock, the Germans came over, they
    met a terrific machine gun fire, while a heavy barrage which was put right
    behind the attacking party and gradually lowered on it not only cut off
    reinforcement for it but killed many in it. The slaughter of Germans in
    this attack was the heaviest the Americans have yet been able to inflict.
    Our men, in excellent positions at the edge of the town, suffered almost no
    losses. In this operation we took fifty prisoners, including one
    officer.</p>

        <div class="caption">
            KING GEORGE'S MESSAGE TO THE SOLDIERS OF THE UNITED STATES
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>The London Times, in describing the occasion, referred to the attitude
    of the British public as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>All along the way people gathered thickly. There were dense crowds
        in the neighborhood of Charing Cross, in the Mall, around the Victoria
        Memorial, and in Grosvenor Gardens. Rarely has the Stars and Stripes
        been so conspicuous in London; the flag flew from public and private
        buildings. It was waved here and there by spectators. It was worn in
        many buttonholes. London Americans set the fashion of bringing flags
        small enough to carry and big enough to add emphasis to a personal
        demonstration. Some English people followed their example, and others
        were heard wishing that they had "brought their American flags from
        home." Street hawkers of buttonhole favors had learned the phrase "Old
        Glory," and shouted it familiarly.</p>

        <p>But the real lesson of the day came from the crowd everywhere. It
        taught those critics who have complained that during the war London has
        forgotten how to cheer, that London still remembers. The people cheered
        the American troops, they cheered the Guards, they had a special shout
        for wounded sailors and soldiers; and by no means did they forget to
        cheer the King. Occasionally, however, there were silences which seemed
        to speak of an understanding of the mission of this array of martial
        youth; of the sacrifice that mingled with the <span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_70" name="Page_70">[Pg 70]</a></span>glory of
        devotion; perhaps also of the history that Britain and America have
        begun to make in union.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The bearing of the American troops was described in the following
    passage:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It is worth noting that when the colors passed many men received
        them with bared heads, and that "Off with your hats!" was heard now and
        then in admonition from a civilian. Considering that the custom of so
        honoring the colors of British regiments is still far from universal,
        this may be accepted by Americans as a rather notable tribute.</p>

        <p>Three things were striking in these Americans—their youth, their
        seriousness, and their modesty. The first quality is easily conceded to
        America; we all think of her as young. Those of her sons whom London
        scrutinized so keenly came under arms only last Summer. They are
        officered chiefly by men who then passed through the Officers' Training
        Corps, thoug the commanding officer and the Lieutenant Colonel belong
        to the old regular army. They might, therefore, be expected to deserve
        the name of boys, by which they were affectionately called. But it was
        their presentation of the idea of youth, of the quintessence of youth,
        which struck the spectator. Nor was it modified by the suggestion of
        dead earnestness which accompanied it and might seem to clash with it.
        The qualities in combination distinguished the American battalions from
        any young English regiment, which strikes the observer as at once older
        and more light-hearted. Not that there was really any lack of hilarity
        about the Americans in their hours of ease. The one who sang a comic
        song in front of the barracks before parade had a joyful heart, and was
        certainly a cause of joy to the Londoners who stood listening to him.
        As for the men's modest demeanor, it ought to dispose of the notion
        that the Americans cherish any intention "to show us how things should
        be done"—if that suggestion is not long since dead.</p>

        <p>Physically, the regiment was marked by well-set shoulders, bronzed
        faces, and general fitness. It looked sinewy, and went along with a
        fine swing. A few men were pointed out for their unusual height.
        Spectators on the outskirts of the crowd had an excellent opportunity
        of appraising these giants. Otherwise the standard of stature was
        level.</p>

        <p>The pride of Americans in the troops—and there were many Americans,
        naval, military, and civil, among the onlookers—was easy to see. Before
        the embassy it reached its highest manifestation. The building was
        decorated with flags, like most of the houses in Grosvenor Gardens. The
        American Ambassador (Mr. Page) took the salute outside the embassy. In
        his company were Admiral Sims, Commander Babcock, and Lieut. Col.
        Slocum. Mrs. Page was an interested spectator in the balcony above.
        Here the bands played "Pack Up Your Troubles" and "John Brown's Body."
        A reminder of American history and of the foundations of the United
        States was introduced when several veterans of the civil war joined the
        procession.</p>

    Army</h2>

    <h3>More Than 700,000 Additional Young Men Registered Under the Draft
    Law</h3>

    <p>On the recommendation of the Secretary of War, who appeared before the
    House Committee on Military Affairs on May 23, the committee agreed to give
    President Wilson authority to raise an army of practically unlimited size.
    The text of the provision to be incorporated in the Army bill was adopted
    unanimously. The committee had originally been in favor of limiting the
    size of the army to 5,000,000.</p>

    <p>On June 5 male residents of the United States who had reached the age of
    21 years since that date in 1917 were required to register under the
    amended selective draft law. Nearly complete reports to the Provost Marshal
    General's office showed that 744,865 men complied with the law. This was
    266,724 below the Census Bureau estimate, but as more than 200,000 did not
    register because they had already enlisted in the army, navy, or Marine
    Corps, the military authorities found the result entirely satisfactory.</p>

    <p>So-called "work or fight" regulations were issued by the Provost Marshal
    General on June 3. All citizens were called upon to report to the nearest
    local board all men of military age who should be in <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_71" name="Page_71">[Pg 71]</a></span> the idler or
    nonproductive classification after July 1, 1918. The local boards were
    given authority to summon any man who may be idle or nonproductively
    employed within its territory.</p>

    <p>With the double purpose of increasing the number of men available for
    military service and of insuring fairer administration of the selective
    service law, Provost Marshal General Crowder on June 7 instituted a
    reinvestigation of the draft classification lists throughout the nation.
    General Crowder believed that by "slacker marriages" and underground claims
    to exemption on the ground of industrial or agricultural work registrants
    had escaped service, and that in some districts the local boards had
    interpreted the regulations too strictly. It was expected that more than
    500,000 men would be brought by the reclassification into Class 1, which
    was being rapidly exhausted.</p>

    <p>Another move toward the full utilization of the nation's man power was
    made on May 24 when the Secretary of War sent to Congress the draft of a
    bill authorizing the raising of the maximum age limit for voluntary
    enlistment in the army from 40 to 55 years. Between these ages there were
    probably 7,500,000 men, and thousands of them have applied to the War
    Department to be allowed to serve. The department planned to assign men
    over 40 years to noncombatant service, which calls for a very large
    proportion of men for every combatant at the front.</p>

    <p>The War Department on June 6 permitted publication of reports to the
    Acting Chief of Ordnance (Brig. Gen. C. C. Williams) showing that since the
    United States declared war 1,568,661 rifles had been produced for the army.
    This total was made up of 1,140,595 modified Enfields, 1917 model; 176,796
    Springfields, 1903 model, and 251,270 Russian rifles. The last named are
    used for training purposes and to equip home guards. There were also the
    equivalent of 100,000 Enfields and 100,000 Springfields made up in spare
    parts. With the rifles already in hand when war was declared, and allowing
    for the fact that only one-half of the soldiers in an army carry rifles,
    the Ordnance Department had enough rifles for an army of about 2,000,000
    men, after making allowance for one year's wastage.</p>

    <p>The organization of five new regiments and nineteen battalions of
    Railway Engineers, to be used in addition to the regiments already working
    in France, was announced by the War Department on June 6. The work was
    carried out by the staff of the Director General of Military Railways,
    Samuel M. Felton, in conjunction with the Engineer Corps. This brought the
    number of Americans engaged in railroad construction and operation in
    France up to 50,000.</p>

    <p>A total of $160,000,000 has been spent on railway materials alone, not
    including supplies provided and used by the Engineer Corps proper. Director
    General Felton, describing the growth in personnel and the increase in the
    size of the task confronting his staff, beginning with the organization of
    the first railway regiment, said that early in 1917 the Chief of Engineers
    decided to organize a railway operating regiment. Mr. Felton, who had acted
    as his railway adviser in 1916, was asked to take charge of the work. Six
    railroads having headquarters in Chicago were called on to recruit one
    company each. The regiment formed the nucleus of the present railway
    organization. While it was being formed, the United States entered the war.
    One of the first requests transmitted to this Government by the French
    Mission was for assistance in strengthening the French railway systems to
    meet the increasing war strain. This request was made in April, 1917, and
    early in May Mr. Felton was called to Washington to organize nine railway
    regiments, including the Chicago regiment.</p>

    <h3>Income Tax Begins at $1,000—New Taxes on Luxuries</h3>

    <p>The new Canadian taxes in the budget for the fiscal year 1918-19 show
    marked increases, especially in income taxes. Exemption in the case of
    unmarried persons is reduced from $1,500 to $1,000, and for married persons
    from $3,000 to $2,000, the rate being 2 per cent. from $1,000 to $1,500 in
    the case of the unmarried and the same amount from $2,000 to $3,000 in the
    case of the married. The present rate of supertax is continued upon incomes
    up to $50,000, and above that there is a gradual increase, reaching 50 per
    cent. on incomes over $1,000,000. In addition there will be a war surtax
    upon incomes over $6,000, running from 5 per cent. on incomes between
    $6,000 and $10,000 and 25 per cent. on incomes over $200,000. It has also
    been decided to grant an exemption of $200 per child. The total war tax on
    incomes over $1,000,000 reaches 77 per cent.</p>

    <p>The tax on tobacco is increased from 10 to 20 cents per pound; on cigars
    from $5 to $6 per 1,000; on cigarettes from $3 to $6 per 1,000; on foreign
    raw leaf tobacco from 28 to 40 cents per pound, and on foreign leaf tobacco
    stemmed from 42 to 60 cents per pound. It has also been decided to place a
    tax of 10 cents per pound on tea, and it is proposed to increase the duty
    on coffee to 5 cents for British coffee and to 7 cents for the general
    tariff. There will be a tax of 8 cents per pack on playing cards and a
    specific rate customs duty of 5 cents per lineal foot on moving-picture
    films. A special war excise tax of 10 per cent. is to be imposed upon the
    selling value of motor cars, jewelry, gramophones, phonographs, mechanical
    pianos, imported into or manufactured in Canada.</p>

    <p>The Minister of Finance stated that $258,000,000 was the revenue for the
    year ended March 31, 1918, with civil expenditures of $173,000,000. The
    increase in interest and pensions for the coming year was estimated at
    $25,000,000. The Finance Minister stated that the war expenditures of the
    last year approximated $345,000,000, of which $167,000,000 had been spent
    in Canada. Up to March 31 the total outlay on the war was approximately
    $878,000,000, which included all expenditures at home and abroad. During
    the last two years they had applied $113,000,000 toward war expenditures,
    in addition to expenditures on interest and pensions. The net debt of
    Canada was now approximately $1,200,000,000.</p>

    <p>He pointed out that trade was annually increasing, and that exports were
    now much greater than imports. The total trade had increased since 1913
    from $1,000,000,000 to $2,500,000,000 last year, the balance of trade in
    favor of Canada being $625,000,000. Exports to Great Britain totaled
    $860,000,000, while imports were only $81,000,000. On the other hand, the
    balance of trade against Canada with the United States was
    $350,000,000.</p>

    <p>Referring to immigration, the Minister of Finance said that, in spite of
    the war, over 200,000 people had entered Canada in the last three years,
    largely farmers from the United States. He anticipated large immigration
    into Canada shortly after the end of the war.</p>

    <h3>An Official Summary of American Activities During the First Year of

    <p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Delivered in the House of
    Representatives, May 22, 1918</span>]</p>

    <p>At the outset, let me say frankly that we have made mistakes—yes,
    grievous mistakes—and had our foresight been as keen as the afterthought of
    our critics we might have accomplished more. But, notwithstanding these
    mistakes and omissions, America has done her share—indeed, more than her
    share—for she has done many times more than any of our allies suspected
    that she was capable of doing and more than the greatest enthusiast in
    America hoped she could do. She has confirmed our friends and confounded
    our enemies. Or, let me put it in another way: America has raised and
    equipped a bigger army in shorter time and now holds a greater section of
    the fighting front, transporting her forces 3,000 miles across an infested
    sea, in ten months, than England was capable of doing in twelve months
    across the English Channel of less than thirty miles. We began with less,
    went further, and arrived with more in shorter time. Yet their motive was
    necessity and ours only desire.</p>

    <p>When war was declared in April, 1917, the standing army of the United
    States consisted of 136,000 officers and men, many of whom were in the
    foreign service, and the National Guard consisted of 164,000 officers and
    men, many of whom were too old for active service, and a large part of them
    physically unfit to perform the duty for which they had volunteered. Our
    experts told us that it would take two years to raise an army of 1,000,000
    men and five years to train the commissioned personnel. It has now been
    about one year since the first legislation was passed authorizing the
    increase of our army for war purposes. The strength of our military forces
    is now as follows:</p>

    <p>Grand total, 2,038,222 officers and men.</p>

    <p>So we have today an army of more than 2,000,000, of which 500,000 have
    already been shipped to France and 1,000,000 more have had the necessary
    training to fit them for foreign service. These are now waiting for the
    boats to carry them over. Our critics now complain that we have not done
    more, yet we have done in one year twice as much as they thought we could
    do in two years.</p>

    <p>When war was declared, each of our allies sent commissions to America to
    advise us what to do and to assist us wherever possible in our preparation.
    The English told us that they did not need men, but they did need money and
    supplies; the Italians that they did not need men, but that they did need
    material and money; the Russians that they did not need men or material,
    but did need money and ammunition; the French told us that they needed raw
    material and money, and asked that a small expeditionary force be sent to
    hearten their people and as an earnest of our intention of seeing the war
    through.</p>

    <p>Under this tutelage and squaring our conduct with the requests of our
    friends, it was thought by many to be inadvisable to attempt to raise an
    army of more than<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_74" name="Page_74">[Pg
    74]</a></span> 1,000,000 men. Congress was therefore requested to pass
    military legislation limiting the army to the 136,000 regulars, the 164,000
    National Guardsmen, and 500,000 drafted men, with authority to call an
    additional 500,000 in case they should be needed. Under the legislation
    that Congress passed, in spite of the recommendation from the Allies, we
    have already raised more than 2,000,000 men, and early in the year 1919
    will have 3,000,000 men in the army. We have lately taken the "lid off" so
    that the President may have as big an army as necessity requires and our
    man power permits. Notwithstanding the fact that the appropriation measure
    now pending before the House is drawn with the view of supporting an army
    of only 3,000,000 men, I am confident that before many months deficiency
    appropriations will be necessary. The army is growing so rapidly and its
    needs are so urgent that the efforts heretofore made will be small in
    comparison with those of the next twelve months. We will probably have
    between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 men before the end of the next fiscal
    year.</p>

    <h3>TWENTY MILLION FIGHTING MEN</h3>

    <p>When we were considering legislation in the Spring of 1917, it was
    thought that our largest task would be getting men. Experience has shown
    that this is easy of accomplishment, made so by reason of the fact that we
    have left open the door for a reasonable amount of volunteers in the
    National Guard and regular army and passed a draft law under which all men
    of military age may readily be mobilized. The justness and fairness of the
    scheme as worked out by the Provost Marshal General have obtained the
    earnest co-operation and enthusiastic support of our people as a whole.</p>

    <p>As I have said, our military law has been amended giving the President
    authority to call additional increments of men from time to time as needed.
    It has also been amended to permit him to register and classify all men
    that reach the age of 21 years. We now have 2,000,000 men in the army. The
    men between the ages of 21 and 31 years in 1917 have been classified, and
    there remains in Class 1 approximately 2,000,000 men physically fit not
    called. The class of 1918, which will be registered this Summer, will add
    another million, making a grand total of 5,000,000, without calling Classes
    2, 3, 4, or 5, containing nearly 6,000,000, and without calling the boys
    from 18 to 21—3,000,000 more. If the war lasts until 1924 there will be
    added 6,000,000 more men. The potential man power of America for a
    seven-year war, therefore, may be conservatively estimated at 20,000,000
    fighting men of recognized military age. This out of a population of
    125,000,000.</p>

    <p>Not because I think that all of our man power will be needed, but in
    order that we may get a view of the task that is in front of us and
    understand the necessity for the large army we are calling and the huge
    expenditures we are making, let me recall these facts.</p>

    <h3>THE ENEMY'S STRENGTH</h3>

    <p>The Central Powers at the outbreak of the war had a population of
    142,250,000, in round numbers, of which 26,310,000 were males between the
    ages of 18 and 44, and if 70 per cent. of them were available for military
    service their man power would be approximately 18,360,000. Since the
    Russian fiasco Germany has occupied a territory greater in area than both
    Germany and Austria, in which there live upward of 51,000,000 people. And
    if the reports that we get are to be believed, the Kaiser has compelled the
    boys between 18 and 21 in this occupied territory to enter the German
    training camps, and he hopes in a short time to have them on the western
    front, thus augmenting his man power to approximately 21,000,000 fighting
    men.</p>

    <p>This is the job we have on our hands. The newspapers tell us that the
    Kaiser has only 2,000,000 or 3,000,000 soldiers, but it would be wise for
    the members of this House in passing legislation affecting the conduct of
    the war to keep in mind the figures that I have just indicated. To meet
    this Great Britain—the British Isles, Canada, Australia, and New
    Zealand—France, Italy, and the United States have a combined population
    from which they can draw 30,000,000 <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_75"
    name="Page_75">[Pg 75]</a></span> or 40,000,000, and in addition to these
    numbers there is an enormous reservoir from which to draw further man power
    in the colonies and possessions of the Allies and the twenty-three smaller
    countries now allied with us in the war. To show something of the relative
    strength of the contending forces I will read the following capitulation,
    which is believed to be substantially accurate and has been compiled after
    very careful inquiry from the best sources available:</p>

    <p>The casualties resulting in death, permanent injury, or incapacity in
    the German Army have amounted to admittedly about 3,000,000 men during the
    four years of war, or approximately the same number as have been supplied
    by the young men who have reached military age during the same period. From
    this statement it would appear that from the point of man power Germany is
    no worse off today than when she started the war. The weakening of the
    German forces is represented, however, by the lack of nourishment for her
    workers, her women and children, and the discharges which must necessarily
    follow the reaching of advanced age by the old men called to the colors,
    both of which will be felt more keenly as time goes on, as well as the
    disease which must necessarily accompany conditions such as the war has
    produced. America will not begin to discharge her men on account of
    advanced age for twenty years. In other words, the man power of America
    will get stronger and the man power of the enemy must get weaker for the
    next twenty years, if, by any chance, the war should last that long. We
    have nothing to fear from this source.</p>

    <h3>DIFFICULTIES ENCOUNTERED</h3>

    <p>The first war difficulty encountered came when we looked for shelter for
    the vast army being assembled. Much to the surprise of every one, it was
    soon discovered that there was not cloth enough in the world to put tents
    over an army the size of the one we were organizing, and there were not
    mills and machinery enough to make it. Therefore wooden cantonments were
    constructed. We built thirty-two cantonments with a floor space of
    640,000,000 square feet, with the necessary water, sewers, lighting plants,
    storehouses, ice plants, hospitals, and recreation centres to take care of
    1,280,000 men, in which undertaking there was used in ten weeks' time more
    human labor than went into the building of the Panama Canal. Besides these,
    we have constructed aviation fields, ordnance schools, and training schools
    for officers—herculean tasks in themselves. We have also put up at the
    ports of embarkation, and throughout the country, supply depots, and
    storage warehouses with a combined floor space of 24,220,000 square feet
    for the army, in addition to what the navy has done in that respect, and
    have constructed the enormous buildings erected for administrative purposes
    in Washington and elsewhere. Verily, your Uncle Samuel is a modern Aladdin,
    who, when he wants a thing devoutly, rubs the lamp of American patriotism
    and the genius of America produces overnight all that he requires.</p>

    <p>When we entered the war we had practically no surplus clothing for our
    army, our reserve supply having been used up in the Mexican expedition. Our
    allies were using practically the full output of<span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_76" name="Page_76">[Pg 76]</a></span> all of our
    mills capable of producing cloth of the character used for uniforms. To
    take over these factories would have discommoded our allies. We met the
    difficulty by a change of the machinery in carpet factories, ducking mills,
    and kindred industries, and have been able to, during the last year, make
    Summer and Winter clothing enough for 2,000,000 men, and have a reserve
    supply of every article of wear for our soldiers sufficient to take care of
    the authorized increase.</p>

    <h3>TRAINING AND EQUIPMENT</h3>

    <p>England trained her first million a whole year in citizens' clothes and
    top hats, with walking sticks for guns, because she could not do otherwise,
    and this in spite of the fact that she was the greatest textile
    manufacturing country in the world and had all America to help her.
    Notwithstanding this shortage, our first 1,500,000 men were trained in
    uniforms and taught the manual of arms with a rifle. When England went into
    the war she had shortly before adopted a new type of gun, but her factories
    were not equipped to supply it. She abandoned her new type of gun, and has
    fought the war thus far with an admittedly inferior type of rifle, a large
    portion of which were made on order in the United States.</p>

    <p>There went up a hue and cry that America adopt a foreign type of rifle,
    notwithstanding the facts that the rifle is the most necessary weapon of
    warfare, and we had the Springfield rifle in substantial quantity,
    admittedly the best rifle then being used in the world, shooting the most
    powerful and efficient ammunition ever prepared. In the face of this
    criticism, we adhered to our own weapon, adopting a modified and
    rechambered Enfield, which differs from a Springfield in such a small way
    that it is not worthy of discussion, now known as the United States rifle,
    model of 1917, resulting in some delay but now being produced in sufficient
    quantity.</p>

    <p>When General Joffre made the request for a small expeditionary force,
    the critics of the Administration demanded what they thought was the
    impossible—i.e., that we ship to France during the first year 50,000 to
    100,000 men. During the first ten days of May we shipped 90,000. Within one
    year after the first shipment America will have an army of 1,000,000 men in
    France, with their necessary arms, equipment, and supplies. It will be the
    best-fed, the best-clothed, the best-paid army of its size that the world
    has ever known, speaking the same language, worshipping the same God, and
    following the same flag. Its personnel will have the quickest perceptions
    of any soldiers in the world, and will have been trained under modern
    conditions, surrounded by the best moral influences, with the lowest
    percentage of disease, and will be nerved by the highest motives that
    actuate men.</p>

    <p>Victory for our cause is therefore certain.</p>

    "Italys_Third_Year_of_War"></a>Italy's Third Year of War</h2>

    <h3>Other Anniversaries, With Official Greetings Exchanged by the Allies
    and the United States</h3>

    <p>The third anniversary of Italy's entry into the war was the occasion of
    an address by Prime Minister Orlando, delivered in the Augusteum at Rome on
    May 24, in which, in reaffirming the unity of the Allies, he said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>For this unity, so solemnly consecrated again today, I express in
        the name of Italy my deep gratitude to all. To England, which could not
        send a more noble or more agreeable messenger than your Royal Highness,
        who brings to us a message reaffirming friendship with our country, a
        friendship which was shown at a time which was painful to us, and which
        has been strengthened by the intimacy of affection in the days of grief
        still more than in those of joy. To France, to our great sister toward
        whom with a feeling of renewed admiration our hearts are turned. To the
        United States, to this <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_77" name=
        "Page_77">[Pg 77]</a></span>young people, powerful in its strength and
        already rich in glory owing to the wisdom of its leader and the
        numerous virtues of its men. To the peoples conquered by the enemy
        because of their smallness, for which reason their heroic sacrifice and
        admirable bravery are all the more apparent. To those nations from the
        Baltic to the Adriatic which the common enemy has oppressed. To the
        oppressed nations in the interior and on the frontiers of enemy States
        which heroically rise in rebellion with the cry "Long Live the
        Entente!"</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the royal box were the Prince of Wales and Prince Peter of
    Montenegro. The vast audience contained the official representatives of all
    the allied powers and the United States, and the leaders of all political
    and social groups of Italy, with representatives from all the important
    cities. The Prince of Wales in his address said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I come to you to assure you of the constant friendship and sincere
        affection of the British people for your nation, whose enlightened and
        precious sympathy is a proof of the creative unity of arms which
        nothing can again dissolve. In the city of Rome, the ancient capital of
        the world, the source of social order and justice, I proudly proclaim
        my conviction that the great object for which our two nations are
        fighting against the forces of reaction is inevitably destined to
        triumph, owing to the union of which our meeting this evening is
        symbolic.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The King of Italy addressed the following Order of the Day to the army
    and navy:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Soldiers on land and sea! The fourth year of war, which began today,
        finds you full of pride for the hard trials you have faced, and which,
        with admirable courage, you have overcome. In face of your firm
        decision to resist to the utmost the enemy was obliged to call a halt,
        and in daring and magnificent actions you have many a time shown him
        the indomitable spirit and resolute will to conquer with which you are
        animated. This priceless energy, revivified by the faith which your
        country has in you, is strengthened still further by the anxiety with
        which your oppressed and despoiled brothers await your coming.</p>

        <p>Soldiers on land and sea! With the sacred image of a country
        entirely freed from the enemy imprinted in the very depths of your
        hearts, together with the ideals of justice and civilization which our
        war has adopted as its aims, I will accompany you in your future
        struggles, certain that the reward for the tireless energy which you,
        in common with our valiant allies, have shown will not be delayed much
        longer.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>President Wilson sent the following message to the Italian people, after
    it had been read by Secretary Lansing at a Washington celebration of
    Italy's anniversary:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I am sure that I am speaking for the people of the United States in
        sending to the Italian people warm fraternal greetings upon this, the
        anniversary of the entrance of Italy into this great war, in which
        there is being fought out once for all the irrepressible conflict
        between free self-government and the dictation of force. The people of
        the United States have looked with profound interest and sympathy upon
        the efforts and sacrifices of the Italian people, are deeply and
        sincerely interested in the present and future security of Italy, and
        are glad to find themselves associated with a people to whom they are
        bound by so many personal and intimate ties in a struggle whose object
        is liberation, freedom, the rights of men and nations to live their own
        lives and determine their own fortunes, the rights of the weak, as well
        as the strong, and the maintenance of justice by the irresistible force
        of free nations leagued together in the defense of mankind. With
        ever-increasing resolution and force we shall continue to stand
        together in this sacred common cause. America salutes the gallant
        Kingdom of Italy, and bids her Godspeed.</p>

    <h2><a id="Frances_Tribute_to_Great_Britain" name=
    "Frances_Tribute_to_Great_Britain"></a>France's Tribute to Great
    Britain</h2>

    <p>Great Britain's "Empire Day" was celebrated May 24 throughout France. In
    Paris there was an imposing demonstration at the Sorbonne, at which were
    present the President of the republic, Ministers, Ambassadors, and
    Deputies. President Deschanel of the Chamber in speaking of "the prodigy of
    Great Britain's effort" said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>This people of seamen and merchants came forward as volunteers in
        crowds; in the Spring of 1915 there were 2,400,000, and at the end of
        the same year 3,000,000. In May, 1916, King George announced that
        5,000,000 men had been raised by voluntary recruitment. But this did
        not suffice. Parliament voted compulsory service, the greatest victory
        that the people ever gained over itself, a triumph of duty and
        conscience, the pledge of that <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_78"
        name="Page_78">[Pg 78]</a></span>victory which we shall win together
        over the enemy.</p>

        <p>When Germany over a year ago proclaimed unrestricted submarine
        warfare, she announced, too, England's capitulation at short notice.
        Instead of that hundreds of thousands of Americans are crossing the
        seas as allies. Germany has united France and England not for the
        present struggle but forever.</p>

        <p>Before the war there was in a Calais belfry a Flemish peal of bells.
        On the clock dial two knights armed with lances—Henry VIII., King of
        England, and Francis I., King of France. Every time the hour struck
        they exchanged lance thrusts—one at 1 o'clock, three at 3 o'clock, and
        twelve at midday. A German shell hit the knights and ended the fight
        forever. It is the only German shell which ever showed esprit, remarked
        a French wit.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Georges Leygues, Minister of Marine, who spoke in the name of the French
    Government, said that, thanks to the maritime supremacy of Great Britain,
    the Entente had the mastery of the sea and could look to the future without
    concern Reviewing the work that the navies silently accomplished, he
    mentioned that in the course of last month they had sunk more submarines
    than the Germans were building. They protected the transports which in
    April disembarked on the coasts of France more than 400,000 soldiers.</p>

    <p>"In the past," he continued, "mastery of the sea was always a powerful
    means of conquest. At present it forms in addition a powerful guarantee
    with which none other is comparable. The enemy knows that he will retain
    neither in the east, nor in the west, nor in the south the territories
    which he momentarily occupies, and he knows, moreover, that he will not
    wrest from us the mastery of the sea. That being so, the issue of the war
    is certain, and the navies take their place in the gratitude of the Entente
    alongside of its incomparable armies."</p>

    <h2><a id="Americas_First_Anniversary_in_France" name=
    "Americas_First_Anniversary_in_France"></a>America's First Anniversary in
    France</h2>

    <p>President Poincaré of France sent the following cablegram to President
    Wilson on June 13, the anniversary of the arrival in France of the first
    American troops:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The Allies, owing to the Russian capitulation, are living through
        the most difficult hours of the war, but the rapid formation of new
        American units and the uninterrupted increase in oversea transportation
        are leading us with certainty toward the day when the equilibrium is
        restored.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>President Wilson replied as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="smcap">Mr. President</span>: Your telegram was
        certainly conceived in the highest and most generous spirit of
        friendship, and I am sure that I am expressing the feeling of the
        people of the United States, as well as my own, when I say that it is
        with increasing pride and gratification that they have seen their
        forces under General Pershing more and more actively co-operating with
        the forces of liberation on French soil.</p>

        <p>It is their fixed and unalterable purpose to send men and materials
        in steady and increasing volume until any temporary inequality of force
        is entirely overcome and the forces of freedom made overwhelming, for
        they are convinced that it is only by victory that peace can be
        achieved and the world's affairs settled upon a basis of enduring
        justice and right. It is a constant satisfaction to them to know that
        in this great enterprise they are in close and intimate co-operation
        with the people of France.</p>

        <p>WOODROW WILSON.<br /></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>President Poincaré also sent a message to General Pershing, heartily
    praising "the gallant troops of your command who behaved so magnificently
    in the recent battles." He expressed the firmest hope in the continuation
    of the American successes.</p>

    <p>General Pershing replied to President Poincaré as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Permit me to thank you, Mr. President, for your kind message on the
        occasion of this anniversary. The enthusiastic reception which Paris
        gave us then has since been extended by all your people to the American
        Army.</p>

        <p>Today our armies are united in affection and resolution, with full
        confidence in the final success which will crown the long struggle for
        liberty and civilization.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The following telegrams were also sent to General Pershing:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>On the anniversary of your arrival in France to take command of the
        American troops I wish, my dear General, to express to you once more
        the greatest admiration for the powerful aid brought by your army to
        the cause of the Allies. With ever-increasing numbers the American
        troops cover themselves with glory under your orders in barring the
        route of the invader. The day is coming when, thanks to the superb
        effort of your country and the valor of persons, the enemy, losing the
        initiative of operations, will be forced to incline before the triumph
        of our ideal of justice and civilization.</p>

    <h2><a id="The_War_in_the_Air" name="The_War_in_the_Air"></a>The War in the
    Air</h2>

    <h3>Attacks by Massed Squadrons of Airplanes Become an Important Factor in
    Battle</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Aerial warfare entered upon a new phase with the opening of the
        German offensive in March, 1918, and largely bore out the prediction
        that the operations in the air would become almost as vital as those of
        infantry and artillery. Since early in the war airmen have been
        performing the scouting and observation functions which formerly
        belonged to the cavalry arm; and as the conflict has developed they
        have also become skilled in the art of harassing the enemy. So far
        these operations had been carried out by individual aviators or
        comparatively small squadrons, but the operations of March, 1918,
        witnessed the definite development of larger squadrons, manoeuvring as
        effectively as bodies of cavalry, and in massed formation attacking
        infantry columns. The possibilities of the new aerial arm were further
        demonstrated in the creation of a barrage, as effective as that of
        heavy artillery, for the purpose of holding back advancing bodies of
        infantry.</p>

        <p>In the first days of the German offensive there took place an aerial
        battle which up to that time was unique in the annals of warfare. It
        was a battle not merely for the purpose of gaining the mastery of the
        air, but to aid allied infantry and artillery in stemming the tide of
        the German advance, and when the drive finally slowed down and came to
        a halt in Picardy, the allied airmen had undoubtedly contributed
        largely to the result.</p>

        <p>During the first two days (March 21-22) of the German drive there
        was comparatively little aerial activity. The aviators on both sides
        were preparing for the impending battle, which actually began on the
        morning of March 23 and lasted all that day and the day following. At
        the end of the two days' struggle the allied airmen had gained a
        decisive victory, the point of which was complete ascendency in the air
        during the next five days, when the German aviators were entirely
        unable to prevent the allied fliers from doing what they liked.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>UNPRECEDENTED AIR BATTLE</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The story of the air battle of March 23-24 reads like one of the
        most extraordinary adventure tales ever imagined. The struggle began
        with squadrons of airplanes ascending and manoeuvring as perfectly as
        cavalry. They rose to dizzy heights, and, descending, swept the air
        close to the ground. The individual pilots of the opposing sides now
        began executing all manner of movements, climbing, diving, turning in
        every direction, and seeking to get into the best position to pour
        machine-gun fire into enemy airplanes. Every few minutes a machine
        belonging to an allied or German squadron crashed to the ground, often
        in flames. At the end of the first day's fighting wrecked airplanes and
        the mangled bodies of aviators lay strewn all over the battlefield.</p>

        <p>All next day, March 24, the struggle in the air went on with
        unabated fury. The allied air squadrons were now on the offensive and
        penetrated far inside the German lines. The German aviators
        counterattacked whenever they could, and more than once succeeded in
        crossing the French lines. But at the close of the second day victory
        rested with the allied airmen, and during the next five days scarcely a
        German airplane took the air.</p>

        <p>The nature of the military operations on the earth below during
        these five days, (March 25-29,) favored the allied airmen and permitted
        them to secure important results in attacking infantry. The Germans
        were advancing through the valley of the Oise and across the Picardy
        plains, while the Allies were endeavoring<span class="pagenum"><a id=
        "Page_81" name="Page_81">[Pg 81]</a></span> bring up sufficient
        reserves to hold back the advance. The fighting was now in the open,
        and except for walls, trees, and ditches there was practically no cover
        of which the Germans could take advantage. This was exactly what suited
        the allied air squadrons as they sallied forth to harass and hamper the
        advancing German columns, which they attacked by day and night. Many
        German units were completely destroyed by showers of bombs, others were
        dispersed and demoralized, and there is no doubt that the allied
        squadrons, unopposed for the time by German aviators, did much to
        retard the advance of the enemy columns. The allied airmen literally
        swarmed in the air, but in carefully organized formations, so that
        their attacks would reap the largest possible gain.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3>ARTILLERY COLUMN SHATTERED</h3>

    <p>Some of the separate episodes illustrate the advantage of unopposed
    aerial operations. On March 25, for instance, a German artillery column
    moving along the road between Guiscard and Noyon, was attacked by French
    airmen and entirely dispersed. The machine gunners in the airplanes killed
    or wounded many horses which either fell down in their harness and blocked
    the road, or, panic-stricken, bolted in all directions, leaving the roads
    and adjoining fields covered with dead men and animals, wrecked guns,
    caissons, and wagons. Bodies of infantry were similarly broken up,
    dispersed, or demoralized. Showers of bombs from the airplanes created a
    barrage, and entire companies of German infantry were annihilated. In
    addition, railroad stations were damaged, transports blocked, and military
    works and depots of all kinds destroyed or put out of commission. At no
    previous time in the war did armies suffer so severely as did the German
    forces during the five days, March 24-29, 1918. The allied airmen did not
    come out unscathed. Many were killed by rifle fire, and many machines were
    lost. But the Allies held the mastery of the air and turned it to the
    fullest advantage, while the Germans were organizing new aerial
    squadrons.</p>

    <p>On the fifth day of this period of allied air supremacy German airplanes
    began to appear once more, and with the organization of new enemy
    squadrons, the Allies' ascendency was no longer uncontested. Richthofen and
    other German air commanders came on the scene with their squadrons, and
    from March 30 onward there was continued fighting in the air between the
    opposing forces.</p>

    <h3>OFFICIAL DESCRIPTION</h3>

    <p>A day-to-day story of the air fighting on the Western front would vary
    little in its recital of duels and raids and battles between opposing
    squadrons. But on some days there was more intense fighting than usual.
    Such a day was April 12, when the Allies achieved the feat of destroying or
    bringing down ninety-three enemy airplanes.</p>

    <p>That day's work is described in Sir Douglas Haig's report from British
    Headquarters:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>On the 12th inst. atmospheric conditions were favorable for flying,
        and a great concentration of our airplanes was effected by us on the
        battlefront. Large numbers of low-flying machines were employed in
        bombing and sweeping with machine-gun fire roads packed with the
        enemy's troops. Thirty-six tons of bombs and over 110,000 rounds of
        ammunition were fired by us.</p>

        <p>While these attacks on ground targets were in progress, other
        formations, flying at a greater height, engaged the enemy's airplanes,
        which were extremely active in this sector. Other machines reconnoitred
        the battle area, bringing back information as to the positions of our
        own and the enemy's troops.</p>

        <p>On the remainder of the British front the usual work in co-operation
        with our artillery was carried out, and a very large number of
        photographs taken.</p>

        <p>In air fighting forty German machines were brought down by our
        airplanes, and twenty other hostile airplanes were driven down out of
        control. In addition, two of the enemy's machines were shot down by
        anti-aircraft-gun fire. Three hostile observation balloons were also
        destroyed. Twelve of our airplanes are missing.</p>

        <p>After dark the incessant bombing carried out by us during the
        previous twelve hours was continued until dawn. Over twenty-two tons of
        bombs were dropped on different targets, including the Don and Douai
        railway stations, two important railway junctions between Mazières and
        <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_82" name="Page_82">[Pg
        82]</a></span>Rheims, and roads leading up to the battlefront in the
        neighborhood of Estaires.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Sir Douglas Haig's report next day stated that low-flying machines
    reconnoitred the battlefront during the day and dropped over 1,200 bombs on
    the enemy's troops on roads leading to the front. The numbers of German
    airplanes destroyed on various days evidence the intensity of the air
    fighting. Thus, reports of successive days showed these totals: 21, 53,
    (two days;) 55, 21, 30, 97, (four days.) On May 25 it was stated that many
    more German airplanes had been added to the total of 1,000 machines
    recorded as having fallen to earth, or having been sent down out of control
    since the opening of the drive on March 21.</p>

    <h3>WORK OF BOMBING SQUADRONS</h3>

    <p>Some slight indication of the work of the bombing planes was given in a
    report of the British Air Ministry, which stated that the number of bombs
    dropped by British airmen over enemy lines in France, opposite the British
    front, during March was 23,099 by day and 13,080 by night. The Germans
    dropped in the area occupied by British troops 517 by day and 1,948 by
    night. During April the British dropped 6,033 bombs behind the enemy lines
    along the British front, and the Germans retaliated with 1,346 in the area
    occupied by British troops.</p>

    <p>By reuniting practically all their available air force in the sector of
    attack the enemy won a short-lived superiority. On June 4 there was a good
    deal of air fighting, that day turning more steadily in favor of the
    Allies, who by the following day had gained the upper hand over the
    Germans.</p>

    <p>A brilliant exploit by French aviators was that briefly recorded in the
    official report of June 5 to the effect that in the valley of the Savière
    French bombardment squadrons threw more than seventeen tons of bombs on
    enemy troop concentrations. Early in the afternoon the airmen were informed
    that a large number of Germans were assembling in the valley of the
    Savière. Owing to the configuration of the ground they were sheltered from
    the fire of artillery and it evident that they intended to reinforce the
    German move westward into the Forest of Villers-Cotterets. Bombplanes were
    sent out.</p>

    <p>The effect of the bombs was tremendous. The German soldiers broke
    headlong for cover, abandoning all thought of fight. Ten minutes later a
    bombplane group of the same strength arrived on the scene. At first no
    Germans were visible; then circling low, the airmen discovered the enemy
    hiding in the horseshoe wood of Hautwison on the eastern side of the
    valley. Again the devoted battalions were subjected to a terrible
    bombardment amid trees that gave no protection. Before the decimated units
    could re-form the first squadron had returned with a new load, and once
    more the wood was filled with the roar of explosions.</p>

    <p>No human morale could stand such triple strain. In vain the German
    officers tried to re-form their panic-stricken men. When the French
    infantry counterattacked they had an easy victory over the weakened forces
    that had made the advance. The airmen's success against the reserves had
    nullified an advance that might have been dangerous.</p>

    <h3>GERMANS FIGHT GERMANS</h3>

    <p>One of the most extraordinary episodes of recent aerial fighting was the
    battle waged on June 5 between two flights of German planes. It was an
    unintentional but disastrous fight between brother aviators, during which
    British pilots joyfully and impartially rendered assistance first to one
    side, then to the other, until so many of the German fliers had been
    destroyed or damaged that the conflict could not continue. According to
    eyewitnesses two British officers in a fighting machine were leading a
    patrol along the lines, when they sighted a German Halberstadt two-seater,
    which, upon their appearance, fired a green signal light. The British
    leaders expected a trap, and waited to see what this unusual performance
    meant. In a short time six German scouts came wheeling out of the blue and
    joined the Halberstadt. Almost at once six other enemy scouts dived out of
    the sun on their comrades, whom <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_83" name=
    "Page_83">[Pg 83]</a></span>apparently mistook for a British patrol about
    to attack the Halberstadt.</p>

    <p>What happened was this: The Halberstadt had been acting as a decoy, and
    the green light had been meant as a signal for assistance. But there had
    been no expectation that two flights of German planes would respond at the
    same time. Not being able to distinguish the markings of their friends—and
    this has happened not infrequently before—the newcomers immediately began a
    furious attack upon them. The British leaders then guided their patrol into
    this mad mêlée and took a hand. The Halberstadt was the first victim, and
    this was shot down by a British commanding machine. Another British fighter
    in the meantime had accounted for two more enemy scouts, which were sent
    swirling to destruction. All the time the German aircraft were continuing
    their bitter battle among themselves, and several of them were seen to go
    down out of control before the engagement finally ended. The British
    leaders by their good judgment had led the Germans into their own trap.</p>

    <h3><a id="ATTACKS_ON_HOSPITALS" name="ATTACKS_ON_HOSPITALS"></a>ATTACKS ON
    HOSPITALS</h3>

    <p>Some hundreds of the personnel and patients of British hospitals behind
    the battlelines were killed and wounded on May 19 in the heavy attack by
    German bombing planes. Among those on the casualty list were several
    nurses, some of whom were killed, and several medical officers who were
    wounded. A large American hospital in the neighborhood escaped. A great
    number of the bombs were of extraordinary size, digging vast craters in the
    hospital grounds, while others were high-explosive shrapnel bombs, which
    scattered bullets through the crowded hospital tents and buildings. A
    three-seated airplane was brought down by gunfire while flying at a low
    altitude, and the occupants were made prisoner. The German Captain and the
    pilot sustained comparatively light shrapnel wounds, while the observer was
    not hurt. When questioned why he had directed his men against hospitals,
    the Captain asserted that he did not see the Red Cross signs. He said that
    he was seeking military objectives and had no desire to molest hospitals.
    With a shrug shoulders, the Captain added that if the British chose to
    build their hospitals near railways, they must expect to get them
    bombed.</p>

    <p>The same group of hospitals was attacked again on the night of May 31.
    Several of them were hit and the casualty list among patients and workers
    was considerable. One hospital was almost demolished when an enemy aviator
    dropped an explosive on it after getting his bearings by letting fall a
    brilliant flare which lighted up the whole district. The raid lasted two
    hours. In one hospital one ward was destroyed and two other wards were
    damaged. Several attendants were killed in this place, and there were other
    casualties. The operating theatre of still another hospital was
    wrecked.</p>

    <p>Altogether between May 15 and June 1 German airmen bombed British
    hospitals in France seven times, causing casualties totaling 991, as
    follows: Killed—Officers, 11; other ranks, 318; nursing sisters, 5; Women's
    Auxiliary Corps, 8; civilians, 6. Wounded—Officers, 18; other ranks, 534;
    nursing sisters, 11; Women's Auxiliary Corps, 7; civilians, 73.</p>

    <p>On the night of May 28 German airmen deliberately dropped bombs on
    hospitals many miles in the rear of the front, in which there were scores
    of American and hundreds of French sick and wounded. A number of Americans
    were slightly injured by flying glass. One French nurse was killed and
    another injured. Several civilians died of wounds.</p>

    <p>In addition to their operations against the Germans in France and
    Belgium, the Allies continued to carry the war into Germany. In a raid
    during the night of May 27 British long-distance bombing machines dropped
    between four and five tons of bombs on chemical works at Mannheim, the
    Landau railroad station, an electric power station at Kreuzwald, and on the
    Metz-Sablons railroad station. Very large explosions were caused and much
    damage done. The same night the important railway triangle at Liége in
    Belgium was bombarded. In spite of determined opposition by German
    airplanes, British aviators on May<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_84"
    name="Page_84">[Pg 84]</a></span> dropped bombs on factories and the
    railroad station at Saarbrücken in Rhenish Prussia.</p>

    <p>Cologne, the sixth largest city of Germany, was raided by British
    bombing planes on May 18. Bombs were dropped on railroad stations,
    factories, and barracks. Eighty-eight of the persons who were killed were
    buried in the same grave. The people of the city became panic-stricken.
    Aix-la-Chapelle was also attacked and factories set on fire.</p>

    <h3>TONS OF BRITISH BOMBS</h3>

    <p>British air squadrons carried out successful raids in Germany on May 31.
    Long-distance bombing machines crossed the Rhine and, in spite of strong
    opposition from enemy aircraft, dropped over a ton of bombs on the station
    and workshops at Karlsruhe. Another group of British airplanes dropped a
    ton of bombs on the railway triangle of Metz-Sablons with good effect and
    without losses. During the course of the day thirty-one tons of bombs were
    dropped on different targets behind the enemy lines. Twenty German machines
    were destroyed in air fighting, and six were driven out of control. During
    the night sixteen tons of bombs were dropped on targets in enemy territory.
    Six tons were dropped on the Bruges docks and on the Zeebrugge-Bruges
    Canal. In addition, four tons were dropped on railway junctions and the
    stations at Metz-Sablons, Karthaus, and Thionville.</p>

    <p>Another typical day's work of the British aviators was that described in
    the official report issued on June 6. On the previous night long-distance
    bombing machines again attacked the Metz-Sablons station triangle and also
    the railway sidings at Thionville, dropping five tons of bombs with good
    results, although the visibility was indifferent. Next morning (June 6) the
    railway station at Coblenz was heavily attacked. The fine weather of June 5
    enabled the British airmen to carry out much photographic, reconnoissance,
    and artillery work. Twenty tons of bombs were dropped on different targets,
    including hostile dumps and railway billets, the Armentières and Roye
    stations, and the Zeebrugge seaplane base. In addition long-distance day
    bombing machines heavily attacked the railway station and barracks at
    Treves, and the Metz-Sablons railway station, and the railways at Karthaus,
    returning without loss. Seven hostile machines and three German observation
    balloons were shot down during the day, and three hostile airplanes were
    driven down out of control. Four of the British machines are missing. On
    the night of June 5 thirteen tons of bombs were dropped on the St. Quentin,
    Boesinghe, Cambrai, and Armentières stations.</p>

    <h3>PARIS AND LONDON RAIDED</h3>

    <p>German aviators made an ineffectual attempt on the night of May 21 to
    raid Paris. Three persons were killed and several wounded in the outskirts
    of the city, but none of the raiders reached Paris itself. The following
    night another attack was made, and this time one of the German aviators
    succeeded in reaching the city. Bombs were dropped at various places,
    causing thirteen casualties, with one killed. German aviators also attacked
    the railroads north and northeast of Paris, but the bombs dropped caused no
    serious damage.</p>

    <p>Forty-four persons were killed and 179 injured in the London area during
    an air raid on the night of May 19. Four of the German machines were
    destroyed, and a fifth fell flaming into the sea. This was the sixth raid
    on London since the beginning of 1918, and with the exception of that on
    Jan. 28 the most disastrous. Many of the casualties were among persons who
    were on the streets or in doorways, thus disregarding the warnings to seek
    shelter.</p>

    <h3>AMERICAN AVIATORS</h3>

    <p>Aerial fighting is the only form of modern warfare which gives
    opportunities for individual deeds of heroism; and every army has its list
    of airmen, dead or alive, who have distinguished themselves in thrilling
    fights high above the earth. Here, because there were Americans fighting in
    the air, mainly with the French, before the United States entered the war,
    this nation has already a <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_85" name=
    "Page_85">[Pg 85]</a></span>record which can vie with that of the other
    belligerents. On April 27 the standing of American aviators based on the
    number of adversaries shot down was as follows: Major Raoul Lufbery, 18;
    Major William Thaw, 5; Lieutenant Frank Baer, 5; Sergeant Baylies, 5;
    Captain Charles Biddle, 2, and Sergeant Vernon Booth, Sergeant August
    Grehore, Second Lieutenant Henry Grendelass, Sergeant Thomas Hitchcock,
    Lieutenant Friest Larner, Sergeant David Putnam, Sergeant W. A. Wellman,
    Lieutenant Allan Winslow, and Lieutenant Douglas Campbell, 1 each.</p>

    <p>As the above list shows, Major Raoul Lufbery was easily America's
    leading airman, having far surpassed the initial record of an "ace,"
    attained when an airman destroys five enemy machines. But his career was
    cut short on May 19, when he was killed in a dramatic combat with a German
    biplane behind the American sector north of Toul. Lufbery lost his life
    after six other American airmen had tried in vain to bring down the German
    machine. A German bullet set his petrol tank on fire, and Lufbery leaped
    from his machine.</p>

    <h3><a id="LUFBERYS_LAST_FIGHT" name="LUFBERYS_LAST_FIGHT"></a>LUFBERY'S
    LAST FIGHT</h3>

    <p>It was early in the morning when the German biplane appeared over the
    American airdromes moving slowly. Immediately the "alerte" signal was given
    and two Americans started up, and two others followed. When they got to a
    height of about 2,500 meters they found themselves face to face with a
    giant German biplane with a wing spread of sixty feet, carrying a pilot and
    two gunners, and driven by two engines. The engines were armored, and the
    pilot sat in a steel house. The gunners wore armor and occupied protected
    positions, each manning a heavy machine gun. The American fighters sent
    streams of bullets in vain against the new enemy.</p>

    <p>By this time other Americans were in the air, trying to bring down the
    German, who loafed along, not seeming to mind bullets at all. The scene, in
    full view for many miles, looked like a lot of swallows pecking at a giant
    bird of prey. When one of the Americans landed, out of ammunition, reported
    his inability to do damage to the German machine, Lufbery asked and
    received permission to try. He mounted up above the German, got his machine
    gun going well, and swept head first at the monster plane. When part of the
    way had been traversed he swerved off, supposedly because his machine gun
    jammed. But in a few minutes he was back at the German again, dashed by
    with his machine gun going, but produced no effect. He was seen to turn and
    start up at the enemy again, when suddenly he swerved and a thin line of
    flame shot from his machine, which seemed to hang still for a moment and
    then dart down. This took place at an altitude of 2,000 meters. When his
    machine was at an altitude of about 1,500 meters the American ace was seen
    to arise and leap into midair. From long experience he knew that to stay in
    his seat meant to be burned to death horribly. His body fell like a
    plummet, landing in the midst of a flower garden back of a residence in the
    village of Maron, while his machine fell in flames and landed on the ground
    a mass of wreckage. At Lufbery's funeral it was announced that the
    battleplane which had caused his death had been brought down by French
    airmen.</p>

    <p>Lieutenant Douglas Campbell, a Californian, by bringing down his fifth
    German airplane on May 31, secured the distinction of being the first
    American-trained ace. Besides Campbell, America then had two other aces,
    Major William Thaw and Captain D. M. K. Peterson, but both Thaw and
    Peterson got their training with the French Army.</p>

    <h3><a id="RICHTHOFENS_DEATH" name="RICHTHOFENS_DEATH"></a>RICHTHOFEN'S
    DEATH</h3>

    <p>Germany has also lost her most aggressive aviator, Captain Baron von
    Richthofen, who commanded the most efficient of the German air squadrons.
    He was killed just after bringing down his eightieth machine. He was shot
    down in an aerial combat near Sailly-le-Sec on the Somme. With his "flying
    circus" of more than twenty followers, Captain von Richthofen flew toward
    the British lines about noon on April 20. Here they met two British
    airplanes, and von Richthofen separated himself from his<span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_86" name="Page_86">[Pg 86]</a></span> followers and
    started on a furious pursuit of these machines. Meanwhile a score of other
    British planes came swirling up and engaged the Germans. The Captain kept
    after his man and attempted to outmanoeuvre him. The British plane, which
    was accompanying the one under attack, got above the German. The three
    machines raced toward the British lines, their machine guns chattering like
    mad. They kept getting lower, until at last, when they were about fifty
    yards back of the British trenches, they were only a few hundred feet high.
    Meanwhile the other German machines were fighting the British squadron more
    than three miles away.</p>

    <p>Machine guns and rifles on the ground came into action against Captain
    von Richthofen, who was also being fired at by at least one of his
    adversaries in the air. Suddenly his machine turned its nose downward and
    crashed to the earth. Examination later showed that the German pilot had a
    bullet through his heart. Von Richthofen was apparently killed while trying
    to break through the British aerial defenses in the Ancre region in order
    that enemy reconnoissance machines might cross the lines to make
    observations on the defenses. A document captured by the British revealed
    the reason for his presence there. It was a communication from the "group
    commander of aviation" to the First Pursuit Squadron, of which von
    Richthofen's eleventh pursuit flight was part, saying: "It is not possible
    to fly over the Ancre in a westerly direction on account of strong enemy
    opposition. I request that this aerial barrage be forced to break in order
    that a reconnoissance up to the line of Marieux-Puchevillers (ten miles
    from the front) may be carried out."</p>

    <p>Richthofen was buried with military honors behind the British lines. A
    large number of British fighting men and aviation officers, as well as
    Americans stationed at a neighboring airdrome, were in attendance.
    Mechanics of an aviation squadron had constructed a coffin, on which they
    placed a plate giving the aviator's name, rank, and other data. The body
    was carried on a motor car, with which marched a firing squad many officers
    and men. Six British air service officers acted as pallbearers. As the
    procession moved to the burial place, scores of busy aviation mechanics
    paused and stood at attention as a tribute to the dead aviator. The Baron
    was buried under a hemlock tree, and the squad fired the last shots across
    the grave.</p>

    <h3><a id="LIST_OF_GERMANS_KILLED" name="LIST_OF_GERMANS_KILLED"></a>LIST
    OF GERMANS KILLED</h3>

    <p>A list printed in the Berliner Zeitung am Mittag on April 24 showed that
    of the forty-one German aviators who had brought down fifteen or more
    opponents since the beginning of the war, nineteen had fallen in action and
    two had been reported missing. The list of the fallen German fliers,

    <p>Lieutenant von Bülow, with twenty-eight victims, and First Lieutenant
    Dostler, with twenty-six, were reported missing.</p>

    <p>At the beginning of the offensive in March, Germany claimed 102 army
    aviators, each of whom had brought down more than seven airplanes or
    balloons in battles, and that the total number of victims up to May of
    these star fliers was 1,698. In this period forty-three of these aces had
    been killed and three were missing. Others probably had been disabled and
    were no longer in service. Of those still alive, whether still in the
    service or not, the ones with the best records were then Lieutenant
    Bongartz with thirty-three victories, Lieutenant Bucker also with
    thirty-three, and Lieutenant<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_87" name=

    twenty-nine.</p>

    <h3><a id="FRENCH_AND_BRITISH_ACES" name=
    "FRENCH_AND_BRITISH_ACES"></a>FRENCH AND BRITISH "ACES"</h3>

    <p>France has produced a number of brilliant military airmen, the latest to
    come into special prominence being Lieutenant René Fonck, who in one day
    (May 10) brought down six German airplanes. This achievement had not been
    equaled even by the late Captain Guynemer, of whom Fonck has become the
    successor in daring, skill, and resourcefulness as an air fighter. On June
    4 it was announced that Lieutenant Georges Madon had won his twenty-eighth
    aerial victory.</p>

    <p>A British airman with an extraordinary record, Captain James B.
    McCudden, who is only 23 years of age, was awarded the Victoria Cross on
    March 29 "for most conspicuous bravery, exceptional perseverance, keenness,
    and very high devotion to duty." He had already won nearly every decoration
    awarded in the British Army, including the Military Medal, the Military
    Cross, and the Distinguished Service Order. He went to France with the
    first British army in August, 1914, and, having had some experience of the
    air, was pressed into service as an observer at Mons and gave valuable
    information of enemy movements during the retreat. As a Sergeant he was
    officially promoted to be an observer, and quickly won fame for his expert
    handling of guns in several stiff fights. As the pilot of a single-seater
    scout McCudden has had over 100 fights and some wonderful escapes without
    sustaining the slightest hurt. The crack German pilot Immelmann was a
    deadly rival, and they had three duels, but the fight was broken off on
    each occasion without either man being able to claim an advantage. In the
    official announcement of the award of the V. C., it was stated that Captain
    McCudden had then accounted for fifty-four enemy airplanes, forty-two being
    definitely destroyed. The official statement added:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>On two occasions he has totally destroyed four two-seater enemy
        airplanes on the same day, and on the last occasion all four machines
        were destroyed in the space of one hour and thirty minutes.</p>

        <p>While in his present squadron he has participated in seventy-eight
        offensive patrols, and in nearly every case has been the leader. On at
        least thirty other occasions, while with the same squadron, he has
        crossed the lines alone, either in pursuit or in quest of enemy
        airplanes.</p>

        <p>The following incidents are examples of the work he has done
        recently:</p>

        <p>On Dec. 23, 1917, when leading his patrol, eight enemy airplanes
        were attacked between 2:30 P.M. and 3:50 P.M. Of these two were shot
        down by Captain McCudden in our lines. On the morning of the same day
        he left the ground at 10:50 o'clock and encountered four enemy
        airplanes; of these he shot down two.</p>

        <p>On Jan. 30, 1918, he, single-handed, attacked five enemy scouts, as
        a result of which two were destroyed. On this occasion he only returned
        home when the enemy scouts had been driven far east; his Lewis-gun
        ammunition was all finished and the belt of his Vickers gun had
        broken.</p>

        <p>As a patrol leader he has at all times shown the utmost gallantry
        and skill, not only in the manner in which he has attacked and
        destroyed the enemy but in the way he has during several aerial fights
        protected the newer members of his flight, thus keeping down their
        casualties to a minimum.</p>

        <p>This officer is considered, by the record which he has made, by his
        fearlessness, and by the great service which he has rendered to his
        country, deserving of the very highest honor.</p>

    <h3>Sixty-nine Sinn Fein Members Imprisoned for Treasonable Relations With
    the Enemy</h3>

    <p>Current History Magazine for June contained a brief reference to the
    arrest of leaders of the Sinn Fein movement in Ireland, May 18, 1918, for
    being in treasonable communication with the Germans. Among the leaders
    arrested was Professor Edward de Valera, President of the Sinn Fein Society
    and a member of Parliament, who had refused to take his seat; also George
    Noble Plunkett, a Count of Rome and Member of Parliament; Mme. Markievicz,
    wife of a Polish Count; Arthur Giffith, one of the founders of the Sinn
    Fein movement; William T. Cosgrove, Treasurer of the Sinn Fein and Member
    of Parliament from Kilkenny City; Joseph McGuinness, Member of Parliament
    for South Longford; Darrel Figgis, an Irish poet; Dr. Richard Hayes,
    Herbert Mellowes, who led the Sinn Fein rising in Galway in 1916; Professor
    Monaghan, President of the local Sinn Fein Club at Drogheda; Pierce McCann,
    President of the East Tipperary Sinn Fein Executive; Frank Drohan,
    President of the Clonmel Sinn Fein Club; Dr. Thomas Dillon, Sean Milroy,
    and Sean McEntee, members of the Sinn Fein Executive; George Nichols,
    Coroner for the County of Galway, and Peter Hughes, Chairman of Dundalk
    Urban Council and a prominent Sinn Feiner. In all sixty-nine were arrested
    and imprisoned in England, not 500, as at first reported. The arrests were
    made between midnight and dawn by domiciliary visits, and were accomplished
    without any disorder, being a complete surprise.</p>

    <h3><a id="OFFICIAL_PROCLAMATION" name="OFFICIAL_PROCLAMATION"></a>OFFICIAL
    PROCLAMATION</h3>

    <p>Preceding the arrests the following proclamation was issued by Field
    Marshal French, Lord Lieutenant of Ireland:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Whereas, It has come to our knowledge that certain subjects of his
        Majesty the King domiciled in Ireland have conspired to enter into
        treasonable communication with the German enemy; And whereas, Such
        treachery is a menace to the fair name of Ireland and its glorious
        military record—a record which is a source of intense pride to a
        country whose sons have always distinguished themselves and fought with
        such heroic valor in the past, in the same way as thousands of them are
        now fighting in this war; And whereas, Drastic measures must be taken
        to put down this German plot, which measures will be directed solely
        against that plot,</p>

        <p>Now, therefore, we, the Lord Lieutenant General and General Governor
        of Ireland, have thought fit to issue this our proclamation declaring,
        and it is hereby declared, as follows:</p>

        <p>That it is the duty of all loyal subjects of his Majesty to assist
        in every way his Majesty's Government in Ireland to suppress this
        treasonable conspiracy, and to defeat the treacherous attempt of the
        Germans to defame the honor of Irishmen for their own ends.</p>

        <p>That we hereby call upon all loyal subjects of his Majesty in
        Ireland to aid in crushing the said conspiracy, and so far as in them
        lies to assist in securing the effective prosecution of the war and the
        welfare and safety of the empire.</p>

        <p>That as a means to this end we shall cause still further steps to be
        taken to facilitate and encourage voluntary enlistment in Ireland in
        his Majesty's forces, in the hope that, without resort to compulsion,
        the contribution of Ireland to those forces may be brought up to its
        proper strength and made to correspond to the contributions of other
        parts of the empire.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="EFFECT_OF_ARRESTS" name="EFFECT_OF_ARRESTS"></a>EFFECT OF
    ARRESTS</h3>

    <p>News of the arrests created a profound sensation in Ireland, but no
    breaches of the peace followed anywhere; in fact, the excitement over
    conscription subsided appreciably after the episode, likewise the
    activities of the Sinn Feiners. The leader of the Nationalists repudiated
    the treasonable work of the Sinn Feiners, and, in consequence of the
    disclosures, the alliance against conscription that had been formed between
    the Nationalists and Sinn Feiners was ruptured.</p>

    <p>On May 25 the British Government issued a statement reviewing the causes
    of the arrests. In this document it was<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_89" name="Page_89">[Pg 89]</a></span> that definite proof was at hand
    that after the abortive rebellion of Easter week, 1916, plans were made for
    a revolt in 1917, but that this miscarried because of America's entry into
    the war and Germany's inability to send troops to Ireland. An uprising in
    Ireland was planned for 1918 after the German offensive in the west had
    been successful and when Great Britain presumably would be stripped of
    troops.</p>

    <p>The discovery of a German-Sinn Fein plot for landing arms in Ireland was
    made about April of this year, and even after the capture, on April 12, of
    the German agent who reached Ireland by submarine, munitions were shipped
    from Cuxhaven in the early part of this month.</p>

    <p>Concerning the arrests in Ireland, the statement said that facts and
    documents, for obvious reasons, could not be disclosed at this time, nor
    could the means of communication between Germany and Ireland.</p>

    <h3><a id="DETAILS_OF_INTRIGUE" name="DETAILS_OF_INTRIGUE"></a>DETAILS OF
    INTRIGUE</h3>

    <p>With reference to the activities in 1918 the text of the statement was
    as follows:</p>

    <p>Professor de Valera, addressing the convention of the Irish Volunteers
    on Oct. 27, 1917, said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"By proper organization and recruiting we could have 500,000
        fighting volunteers in Ireland. That would be a big army, but without
        the opportunity and means for fighting it could only be used as a
        menace. There already has been too much bloodshed without success, and
        I would never advocate another rebellion without hopeful chances of
        success. We can see no hope of that in the near future, except through
        a German invasion of England and the landing of troops and munitions in
        Ireland. We should be prepared to leave nothing undone toward that
        end."</p>

        <p>On another occasion in January of this year de Valera said: "As long
        as Germany is the enemy of England, and England is the enemy of
        Ireland, so long will Ireland be a friend of Germany."</p>

        <p>For some considerable time it was difficult to obtain accurate
        information as to German-Sinn Fein plans, but about April, 1918, it was
        ascertained definitely that a plan for landing arms in Ireland was ripe
        for execution, and that the Germans only awaited definite information
        from Ireland as to the time, place, and date.</p>

        <p>The British authorities were able to warn the Irish command
        regarding the probable landing of an agent from Germany from a
        submarine. The agent actually landed on April 12 and was arrested.</p>

        <p>The new rising depended largely upon the landing of munitions from
        submarines, and there is evidence to show that it was planned to follow
        a successful German offensive in the west and was to take place at a
        time when Great Britain presumably would be stripped of troops.</p>

        <p>According to documents found on his person, de Valera had worked out
        in great detail the constitution of his rebel army. He hoped to be able
        to muster 500,000 trained men. There is evidence that German munitions
        actually had been shipped on submarines from Cuxhaven in the beginning
        of May, and that for some time German submarines have been busy off the
        west coast of Ireland on other errands than the destruction of allied
        shipping.</p>

        <p>It will thus be seen that the negotiations between the executive of
        the Sinn Fein organization and Germany have been virtually continuous
        for three and a half years. At first a section of Irish-Americans was
        the intermediary for most of the discussions, but since America's
        entrance into the war the communication with the enemy has tended to be
        more direct. A second rising in Ireland was planned for last year, and
        the scheme broke down only because Germany was unable to send
        troops.</p>

        <p>This year plans for another rising in connection with the German
        offensive on the western front were maturing, and a new shipment of
        arms from Germany was imminent.</p>

        <p>An important feature of every plan was the establishment of
        submarine bases in Ireland to menace the shipping of all nations.</p>

        <p>In the circumstances no other course was open to the Government if
        useless bloodshed was to be avoided and its duty to its allies
        fulfilled but to intern the authors and abettors of this criminal
        intrigue.</p>

    <h3><a id="LANDING_FROM_SUBMARINE" name=
    "LANDING_FROM_SUBMARINE"></a>LANDING FROM SUBMARINE</h3>

    <p>On June 10 it was announced that the man who was put ashore on the west
    coast of Ireland from a German submarine on April 12, 1918, and who is now
    a prisoner in the Tower of London, was Lance Corporal J. Dowling of the
    Connaught Rangers. The collapsible boat in which Dowling was landed was
    made of canvas with a bottom of twenty-three wooden slats, each four inches
    wide, making the boat about eight feet long and two feet wide. The canvas
    sides, about twenty inches high, had an inner lining<span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_90" name="Page_90">[Pg 90]</a></span> rubber fabric,
    to be blown up from a valve at the rear to give the boat buoyancy. There
    were loops along the sides in which short wooden braces or struts kept the
    boat from collapsing. The whole craft when rolled up weighed less than
    forty pounds. When the buoyancy chambers were pumped full of air the boat
    would easily support three men.</p>

    <p>No effort had been made up to June 20 to put into execution the
    conscription law in Ireland, notwithstanding there had been a very meagre
    response to the call for volunteer enlistments.</p>

    <p>It must be remembered that Ireland has now no foreign imports, and has
    to feed herself as well as help Great Britain. She consumes only one-fourth
    of her own cattle, and with only 10 per cent. of the population supplies 40
    per cent. of the cattle and 30 per cent. of the pigs of the United Kingdom,
    despite shortage of imported cattle cakes, &amp;c., formerly obtainable.
    Ireland also, by her position with regard to Great Britain, minimizes loss
    by U-boats, and by her proximity also makes more trips possible, and
    consequently more cargoes landed in a short time than is possible by any
    foreign nation or British possession.</p>

    <p>As regards increased tillage, under the 1918 orders it is required that
    in holdings of over ten acres the area under cultivation this year must be
    15 per cent. of the total arable land of the holding, in addition to that
    under cultivation in 1916, and in the case of holdings of over 200 acres 20
    per cent. of the arable area. The result is that at the present time there
    are well over 1,000,000 more acres under cultivation than in 1916, a large
    proportion of such cultivation being voluntary. In County Limerick alone
    the area under corn crops shows an increase of 148 per cent., and that of
    all green crops, potatoes, mangolds, and turnips, of 33 per cent.</p>

    <h2><a id="New_Austro-German_Alliance" name=
    "New_Austro-German_Alliance"></a>New Austro-German Alliance</h2>

    <h3>Official Declarations Regarding It by the Chief Ministers of Both
    Empires</h3>

    <p>The official text of the new treaty of alliance between Germany and
    Austria-Hungary—as a result of the meeting of the Emperors, May 12,
    1918—was not made public. Baron Burian, Austro-Hungarian Foreign Minister,
    made the following declaration regarding it on May 16:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The extension of the alliance, which in long years of peace had
        deeply penetrated the minds of the peoples and has stood the test of
        hard times, not only corresponds with what has now become a historic
        necessity, and is not only an imperative necessity, owing to the fact
        that Austria-Hungary and Germany, who are surrounded by a ring of
        common enemies, must firmly hold together in the centre in order to be
        able to resist the terrible embrace, but it also corresponds with the
        requirement of all patriotic Austrians, Hungarians, and Germans who
        think clearly about our future.</p>

        <p>Austria-Hungary and Germany do not desire to renew or extend the
        alliance in order to attack or oppress any one in the world, but to
        stand by each other when their vital interests are assailed. The new
        alliance will again be a defensive alliance, which today serves to
        bring about peace and will in future serve for its preservation. It
        will show the world that Austria-Hungary and Germany united are not to
        be beaten, and will convert our opponents to peace by the strength of
        our will for peace.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Dr. Wekerle, the Premier of Hungary, announced in the Hungarian lower
    house that the new alliance was a strengthening of the existing alliance
    and was for a considerable period. He added:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I think that it will be a matter for general approval by Hungarians
        that our interests are so well looked after, and that they will be
        maintained by such a proved alliance. This alliance is therefore being
        renewed, and very naturally it will also extend to those questions
        which are directly connected with it. Naturally certain military
        agreements will also be concluded, but these cannot be called a
        military convention.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Count Michael Karolyi here interjected inquiry, "During the war?" Dr.
    Wekerle proceeded:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Agreements may be concluded during the war relating to common action
        and common equipment, but having no connection with army organization
        as such. We shall in no respect give up our right of decision as
        regards economic rapprochement. Count Karolyi continually talks about
        "Central Europe," but "Central Europe" is a very vague idea. No one
        doubts that closer economic ties are desirable and also possible. I
        repeat that we shall not give up in a single respect our independent
        right of decision. The validity of the economic agreement will depend
        on the approval of the House. War aims were not discussed, for there
        can be no question of war aims.</p>

        <p>The entire alliance aims only at the maintenance of peace in all
        directions. The alliance can but improve the mutual relations between
        us allies, but it is not to be regarded in any way as a hindrance to
        any eventual relations which may be established in the economic domain
        with other nations; neither is it a hindrance to an eventual entrance
        into the so-called League of Nations. The guarantee lies in the fact
        that we have arranged a purely defensive alliance.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="ANDRASSYS_VIEWS" name="ANDRASSYS_VIEWS"></a>ANDRASSY'S
    VIEWS</h3>

    <p>Count Julius Andrassy, one of the most influential statesmen of
    Austria-Hungary, in a public statement discussed the new alliance in
    detail. He asserted that when Bismarck and the elder Andrassy were
    negotiating the treaty of alliance in 1879 the Iron Chancellor expressed a
    wish that the two great powers should conclude a defensive and offensive
    alliance against every eventuality. Andrassy, however, was absolutely
    opposed to this, and, being convinced that the German statesman would give
    way, was determined to break off the negotiations altogether rather than
    conclude an alliance of such a general character. His view prevailed, Count
    Julius added, and the treaty was directed exclusively against Russia.</p>

    <p>The treaty which was discussed by the<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_92" name="Page_92">[Pg 92]</a></span> two leading statesmen at
    Gastein nearly forty years ago, and which has since then directed the
    events of the world, has served its purpose so well, the Count continued,
    that it has become superfluous in its old form. "It has smashed the
    adversary against whom it provided protection." The treaty in its new form,
    he asserted, is merely an adaptation of the original one to altered
    conditions. In 1879, he stated, Russian Imperialism was the only common
    danger for Austria-Hungary and Germany, and it was appropriate therefore
    that the alliance should be directed against Russia. Now, however, the
    situation is completely changed, and "the danger against which we must
    protect ourselves is no longer Russian imperialism but the permanent
    animosity of, and possible new attacks by, those countries which have
    endeavored during the last four years, while straining all their forces to
    the utmost capacity, to annihilate the Central Powers and split them up
    into their component parts."</p>

    <h3><a id="PARTITION_OF_AUSTRIA" name="PARTITION_OF_AUSTRIA"></a>PARTITION
    OF AUSTRIA</h3>

    <p>The chief aim of those powers, according to Andrassy, is the partition
    of Austria-Hungary, on the ground that a lasting peace can be assured only
    by giving autonomy on a democratic basis to the various nationalities
    composing the Dual Monarchy. "Our present need is thus," he added, "an
    alliance that will protect us against these dangers of the future as it has
    protected us in the past." The Hungarian statesman considers it possible
    also that in course of time the old danger may revive in a new form, for
    the idea of a union of all Slavs in a Socialist Republican Confederation is
    the old program of most Russian revolutionaries and agitators. For this
    reason, too, he contends, the alliance in its new form is imperatively
    necessary, though the immediate danger has to be met first.</p>

    <p>"It is only by holding together those forces which have saved our two
    empires now," he asserted, "that we can protect ourselves against the
    future danger that menaces us in the form of a fresh attempt on the part of
    our adversaries to attain what they are this time unable to attain." The
    world is today divided into two parts, Count Julius observes, and he
    declares that it would be illusion and fanaticism to believe that things
    will be otherwise in the near future. He wishes to make it clear that the
    Central Powers are not responsible for this, and maintains that the new
    Dual Alliance is formed to insure that another already existing alliance
    shall not imperil "our existence and our future." He wishes also to point
    out most emphatically that the new Dual Alliance, like the old one, is
    purely defensive.</p>

    <p>He believes that when this war is over no nation will be inclined to
    pursue an aggressive foreign policy, but he, nevertheless, maintains that
    guarantees must be given that neither of the contracting parties shall be
    involved in any plans of conquest and hegemony cherished by the other. He
    insists, furthermore, that the peace concluded with their defeated enemies
    by the victorious allied Central Powers must manifest clearly that it is no
    obstacle to the development of an international law which would prevent the
    waging of war as much as possible, and would settle the armament question
    on an international basis, and also that this alliance does not wish to
    continue to fight after peace has been concluded, but will pursue a
    peaceable policy in every respect; that it does not wish to be exclusive,
    but is desirous of effecting a friendly rapprochement with the countries
    today opposed to it.</p>

    <p>Finally, he expressed the opinion that the interest of the Dual Alliance
    requires that "our relationship also with Bulgaria and with Turkey shall be
    made stable and shall be strengthened."</p>

    <h3><a id="THE_TWO_EMPERORS" name="THE_TWO_EMPERORS"></a>THE TWO
    EMPERORS</h3>

    <p>The following exchange of telegrams between Emperor Karl and the Kaiser
    was made public on May 15:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>At the moment of leaving the favored soil of the German Empire on my
        way home I feel impelled again warmly to greet you and to express my
        heartiest thanks not only for the very gracious but also for the truly
        friendly reception which you gave me yesterday. I am highly satisfied
        with our harmonious conference. From my heart and in true friendship I
        say may we soon meet again. <span class="smcap">Karl.</span><br /></p>
    </blockquote>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_93" name="Page_93">[Pg
    93]</a></span></p>

    <p>The Kaiser telegraphed in reply:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Many thanks for your friendly telegram. I am exceedingly glad that
        you are so satisfied with your visit here. It is a great joy to me also
        to have seen you and to have again established in our detailed
        discussions our entire accord regarding aims which guide us. Their
        realization will bring great blessings on our empires. I hope soon to
        be in a position to take advantage of your kind invitation. Hearty
        greetings to Zita and yourself. In true friendship. <span class=
        "smcap">Wilhelm.</span></p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="CHANCELLORS_STATEMENT" name=
    "CHANCELLORS_STATEMENT"></a>CHANCELLOR'S STATEMENT</h3>

    <p>Count Hertling, the German Chancellor, in a statement regarding the new
    understanding between the two empires, said that the agreement had not been
    signed, but the basic ideas had been agreed upon. He added:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The deepening and further development of the work created by the
        great statesman Bismarck and by Count Andrassy will assuredly have
        beneficial consequences for Germany and Hungary. I need not specially
        emphasize the fact that all efforts aiming at the improvement of German
        and Hungarian relations and at bringing the peoples closer together
        have my warmest sympathy. M Clemenceau, who indulged in the illusion
        that he would be able to sever our firm alliance, will now be able to
        see from the results of the negotiations the fruits of his intrigues.
        The new Dual Alliance will, in particular, comprise two important
        sections, namely, the economic and military agreements.</p>

        <p>The economic union of Germany and Austria-Hungary is not aimed at
        any State whatever. I am quite prepared for aggressive intentions and
        tendencies to be ascribed to us by our opponents, and the watchword
        given out by the Entente of an economic war after the war against the
        Central Powers can now go ahead. This assertion, however, is entirely
        false. We want nothing but our place in the sun. We are quite entitled
        to harmonize our common interests and to act together. As regards the
        military side of the discussions, I must emphasize the fact that our
        agreements for the future have no aggressive character. We only desire
        the consolidation of our present relations. We also desire to remain
        just as closely bound together after the war as during the war, which
        has drawn us together.</p>

        <p>If the world should one day unite in an International Peace League
        Germany would unhesitatingly and joyfully join in. Unfortunately the
        present conditions give very little hope of that. Our desire is to win
        and to preserve peace. Our policy has ever been a policy of peace, just
        as our alliance with the monarchy is a peace alliance; that is, an
        alliance for the preservation of peace. We are now fighting for our
        existence and for peace, which we also long for.</p>

        <p>I am still optimistic enough to believe that we shall have peace
        this year. I say "optimistic," as the speeches which we hear from
        Entente statesmen still talk of crushing the Central Powers. It might
        have been thought that the attacks on Mr. Lloyd George, which, after
        all, indicate a strengthening of the peace idea, would have created a
        better basis for possibilities of peace. That, however, has not been
        the case. At the moment I cannot say more than that I cherish firm
        confidence that further events in the west will bring us nearer to a
        speedy end of the war, and that the alliance of Germany and
        Austria-Hungary, which has been tested and extended during the war,
        will then bring renewed prosperity and rich blessings.</p>

    <p>Djuber Castle, in the Crimea, became the compulsory residence of the
    Romanoff family in April, 1918, after their removal from Tobolsk, Siberia.
    A correspondent of the Frankfurter Zeitung who visited the ex-Czar in May
    gives this account of his new prison home:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>"The castle is splendidly situated with a commanding view of the
        sea. The vicinity is embellished by beautiful residences. Twenty-five
        Soviet soldiers form the special guard of the former imperial family;
        armed with rifles and machine guns and hand grenades, they are under
        the orders of one officer. These soldiers are determined to prevent any
        attempt at flight, but, on the other hand, they are also firmly
        resolved to protect the ex-imperial family against any odious attack.
        Till recently the Romanoffs spent money freely on their garrison, but
        now they have financial difficulties, and can no longer pay the
        soldiers so well. The presence of the Soviet soldiers is sometimes
        irksome to the imperial family, but at times they are also glad to show
        their appreciation at being protected against the raids of brigands who
        infest the country. * * * Grand Duke Nicholas refused to be

    Prisoners</h2>

    <h3>Franco-German Agreement, Signed at Berne, Provides for Release of More
    Than 300,000 Captives</h3>

    <p>The exchange of certain classes of French, Belgian, and German
    prisoners, totaling about 330,000, began on May 15, 1918, in accordance
    with an agreement arranged at Berne, Switzerland, by a conference of French
    and German delegates held there from April 2 to April 26, and later
    ratified by both Governments. It was announced at the same time that Italy
    had completed a similar arrangement.</p>

    <p>The news of the Franco-German agreement came as a complete surprise to
    Great Britain and the other allies, and aroused an instant demand for
    negotiations looking to a release of British prisoners on similar terms.
    There was a tendency in some quarters to criticise the French Government
    for its separate action in the matter. After a lively debate on the subject
    in the House of Commons on May 28, Lord Newton, head of the Prisoners of
    War Department, stated that the British Government had "already entered
    into negotiations with the German Government with a view to arranging a
    wide scheme of exchange, following, broadly speaking, the agreement
    recently concluded between France and Germany." On the same day a dispatch
    from Holland announced that both the British and German Governments had
    informed the Netherlands Government that they wished to send delegates to
    The Hague shortly to discuss matters relating to the exchange of
    prisoners.</p>

    <h3><a id="TOTALS_OF_PRISONERS" name="TOTALS_OF_PRISONERS"></a>TOTALS OF
    PRISONERS</h3>

    <p>Between 4,000,000 and 5,000,000 prisoners have been taken on both sides
    since the beginning of the war. The latest exact figures on the subject
    were published in the Summer of 1917, when the Central Powers held
    2,874,271 prisoners, and the Entente Allies held a total of 1,284,050.
    Germany alone had 1,690,731 prisoners, including 17,474 officers;
    Austria-Hungary, 1,092,055; Bulgaria, 67,582, and Turkey, 23,903, a total
    of 2,874,271, of whom 27,620 are officers. This total was made up of the

    <p>At the same time Switzerland was sheltering 26,000 interned war
    prisoners, of whom 16,000 were French, English, and Belgian, while 10,000
    were German. In addition, 7,000 relatives were visiting interned men in
    Switzerland. Most of these interned prisoners will be released by the new
    agreements, while other thousands will take their place.</p>

    <h3><a id="FRANCO-GERMAN_TERMS" name=
    "FRANCO-GERMAN_TERMS"></a>FRANCO-GERMAN TERMS</h3>

    <p>The Franco-German agreement, which, being the first exhaustive document
    of its kind in this war, will serve as a model for those that follow,
    provides that all privates and noncommissioned officers who have been
    prisoners in France and Germany for eighteen months shall be exchanged, man
    for man and rank for rank, in the order of priority of capture. Officers
    over 48 years of age are to be released, and certain other classes of
    officers are to be interned in Switzerland, while the French and Belgian
    interned soldiers already in Switzerland are to be released. It is
    estimated that there are 150,000 prisoners on each side who will be
    exchanged under the Franco-German agreement alone, and as transportation
    difficulties will prevent the moving of more than 10,000 a month each way,
    the repatriation of the 300,000 or more who have been in captivity since
    1914 will require at least fifteen months. The interned civilians, it is
    stated, should all be back in their own countries in six months. The
    release terms are to go on applying to later prisoners as soon as their
    captivity amounts to eighteen months.</p>

    <p>The status of citizens of occupied territory is profoundly modified by
    the provisions of the agreement, which expressly stipulate that
    deportations shall cease. Both sides bind themselves not to use released
    soldiers or civilians in war work. The validity of Germany's promise on
    this point was a theme of bitter comment in England when the terms of the
    French agreement first became known.</p>

    <h3><a id="SUMMARY_OF_DOCUMENT" name="SUMMARY_OF_DOCUMENT"></a>SUMMARY OF
    DOCUMENT</h3>

    <p>The most important articles in the Franco-German convention, which is
    very long, may be summarized as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Article 1. Direct repatriation, without regard for rank or numbers,
        for sub-officers, Corporals, and soldiers who have been in captivity at
        least eighteen months at the time when this agreement goes into force:
        (a) who have reached the age of 40 years and are not yet 45, and are
        fathers of at least three living children; (b) who have reached the age
        of 45, but are not yet 48.</p>

        <p>Art. 2. Direct repatriation, man for man and rank for rank, for
        sub-officers, Corporals, and soldiers in captivity for at least
        eighteen months, and not included in any of the classes mentioned in
        Article 1.</p>

        <p>Art. 3. In the exchange provided for in Article 2 no distinction
        will be made between sub-officers. Corporals will be ranked with
        them.</p>

        <p>Art. 4. Internment in Switzerland, without regard for rank or
        numbers, for all officers in captivity at least eighteen months: (a)
        who have reached the age of 40 years and are not yet 45, and are the
        fathers of at least three living children; (b) who have reached the age
        of 45 years, but are not yet 48.</p>

        <p>Art. 5. Internment in Switzerland, man for man, regardless of rank,
        for sub-officers in captivity at least eighteen months and not included
        in the foregoing categories.</p>

        <p>Art. 6. The order of priority for repatriation and internment shall
        be determined by priority of captivity and by equal duration of
        imprisonment after considering age. If this order cannot be followed
        exactly, the repatriation of the prisoner who has to remain shall not
        be delayed beyond two months at most.</p>

        <p>Art. 9. Repatriation, without regard to rank or numbers, for
        officers, sub-officers, Corporals, and soldiers who were taken prisoner
        prior to Nov. 1, 1916, and who on April 15, 1918, find themselves
        interned in Switzerland by reason of wounds or illness.</p>

    <h3><a id="TRANSPORTING_PRISONERS" name=
    "TRANSPORTING_PRISONERS"></a>TRANSPORTING PRISONERS</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Art. 10. The repatriation of these prisoners shall be effected in
        the following manner: Each train in either direction shall contain 700
        prisoners of war to be exchanged, man for man. Each train coming from
        Germany, moreover, shall contain 100 French prisoners of war designated
        in Article 1, and each train from France shall contain 50 German
        prisoners of the same category, until the total in this class on both
        sides is exhausted. The repatriation shipments should contain a monthly
        average of 15 per cent. of noncommissioned officers and 85 per cent. of
        privates.</p>

        <p>Art. 11. At the beginning of each series of ten trains of private
        soldiers there shall be formed on each side a convoy of 400 officers to
        be interned in Switzerland in accordance with Article 5. This convoy
        shall include, besides, 100 French officers coming from Germany and 50
        German officers coming from France to be interned under Article 4,
        until the total on each side is exhausted.</p>

        <p>Art. 12. The first two trainloads of officers provided for in
        Article 11 shall start from Lyons, the third from Constance, the fourth
        from Lyons, and so on alternately. The first ten trains of private
        soldiers arranged for under Article 10 shall start from Constance; the
        ten trains of the second series shall go from Lyons, and so on
        alternately.</p>

        <p>Art. 13. Prisoners of war who do not yet come under the conditions
        prescribed in Articles 1-5 shall be repatriated or interned in
        Switzerland, as the case may be, as rapidly as the prescribed
        conditions are fulfilled.</p>

        <p>Art. 14. Officers in sound health who are interned in Switzerland
        either under the present agreement or under the Berne agreement of
        March 15, 1918, cannot be repatriated save in exceptional cases and
        solely for serious illness or accident.</p>

        <p>Art. 16. Article 19 of the Berne convention of March 15, 1918,
        concerning the employment of repatriated soldiers shall be applicable
        to prisoners benefiting from the present agreement. Released Belgian
        prisoners can be employed in France under the same conditions as
        repatriated French prisoners.</p>

        <p>Art. 17. All the foregoing provisions are to apply to German
        prisoners of war captured by Belgian troops and to Belgian prisoners
        taken by German troops. The Belgian officers, <span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_96" name="Page_96">[Pg
        96]</a></span>sub-officers, and soldiers shall be included in the
        repatriated and interned French groups in the proportion of one Belgian
        for ten Frenchmen, up to the exhaustion of the number of German war
        prisoners who were captured by Belgian troops and who come under the
        foregoing provisions.</p>

        <p>Art. 18. In the repatriation and internment of prisoners under
        Articles 1-5 only men in sound health are to be counted. Ill or wounded
        prisoners will continue to be repatriated directly or interned in
        Switzerland under the conditions laid down under Articles 7-18 of the
        Berne agreement of March 15, 1918.</p>

        <p>Art. 20. The provisions contained in Articles 1-19 of the present
        convention shall cease to be in force on Aug. 1, 1919, if one of the
        two Governments shall have given notice to that effect to the Swiss
        Political Department before May 1, 1919.</p>

    <h3><a id="FOOD_FOR_PRISONERS" name="FOOD_FOR_PRISONERS"></a>FOOD FOR
    PRISONERS</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The articles following those just summarized relate to the treatment
        of prisoners remaining in captivity. The most important are these:</p>

        <p>Art. 25. The daily rations of officers must be sufficient in
        quantity and quality, especially as regards meat, vegetables, and
        seasoning, after taking into account the food restrictions imposed upon
        the civil population. The management of food supplies by the prisoner
        officers themselves is to be favored in every way.</p>

        <p>Art. 26. The daily rations allotted to imprisoned privates in
        Germany and in France must contain a minimum of 2,000 calories for men
        not working, 2,500 calories for ordinary workers, and 2,850 calories
        for prisoners doing heavy work.</p>

        <p>Art. 27. Prisoners of war shall, in general, receive the same ration
        of meat as the civil population.</p>

        <p>Art. 28. The minimum ration of bread allotted to imprisoned German
        officers, sub-officers, and soldiers in France is fixed at 350 grams a
        day. It will be increased to 400 for prisoners working outside the
        camp. The minimum bread ration allotted to French war prisoners in
        Germany is the same as that for the civilian population and is never
        allowed to go below 250 grams.</p>

        <p>Art. 29. The German Government authorizes for all war prisoners a
        collective assignment of bread at the rate of two kilograms (four
        pounds) of bread per man per week. The providing and distributing of
        these consignments of food will continue to be assured for all the
        camps and detachments affected by the present agreement. The provisions
        are to be sent free and by fast freight. The consignments are to be
        distributed without any charge whatever and by the most direct and
        rapid routes available. The empty sacks can be returned to the country
        of origin.</p>

        <p>Art. 33. The provisions of Articles 25-32 are applicable to Belgian
        prisoners in Germany as well as to German prisoners who have fallen
        into the power of the Belgian Government and are now in France.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="LIBERATING_CIVILIANS" name="LIBERATING_CIVILIANS"></a>LIBERATING
    CIVILIANS</h3>

    <p>The second part of the agreement deals solely with civilian
    prisoners:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Art. 1. Civilian prisoners, regardless of age or sex, are
        authorized, upon their own demand and under conditions hereafter
        stated, to leave the country where they are held; this applies alike to
        interned persons and to those who have been liberated after a period of
        internment.</p>

        <p>Art. 2. The word internment is to include all civilians who,
        whatever the cause or date of their commitment, are or have been
        detained in any place of internment against their will.</p>

        <p>Art. 3. Civilians who at the beginning of the war had their domicile
        or habitual residence either in the State where they are or on the free
        territory of the other State will be conducted to the Swiss frontier,
        whence they can proceed to Germany if they come from France or to
        France if they come from Germany.</p>

        <p>Art. 4. Civilians who at the beginning of the war had their homes in
        a locality of the occupied regions will be sent back there. They can
        ask to be taken to the Swiss frontier, and the request will be complied
        with whenever military necessity does not stand in the way. In cases
        where, for military reasons, the return of such persons to their homes
        is impossible, the civilians in question shall be sent to the frontier
        or to another part of the occupied territory, which will be assigned to
        them, as nearly as possible, in accordance with their wishes.</p>

        <p>Art. 5. If a civilian desires to remain in the territory or State
        where he now is interned, he will be authorized to do so on condition
        that his residence there shall be permanent.</p>

        <p>Art. 9. The civilians interned in Switzerland at the moment when
        this agreement goes into effect will be freed from internment.</p>

        <p>Art. 12. Civilians who return to their country under the present
        agreement cannot be employed in military service, either at the front,
        or in the war zone, or in the interior of occupied enemy territory, or
        in the territories or possessions of an allied State.</p>

        <p>Art. 13. The arrangements for the liberation of civilians shall be
        put into operation immediately after this agreement goes into effect.
        Reckoning from that date, the transportation ought to be finished in a
        space of not more than three months for civilians now actually interned
        and six months for those interned at some time in the past. This
        transportation will be furnished free.</p>

    "The_following_articles_deal_with_the_population_of_occupied_territory"></a>The
    following articles deal with the population of occupied territory:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Art. 17. The inhabitants of occupied territory cannot be compelled
        to work, except under the following rules: The work must be done under
        the best material and moral conditions, with due regard to personal
        aptitudes, social conditions, sex, age, and the physical status of the
        workers. Members of a family, so far as possible, must not be
        separated. Their labors must never involve any obligation to take part
        in war operations against their own country. Work can be demanded only
        (a) as service for the needs of the army of occupation, within the
        limitations laid down in Article 52 of The Hague Convention regarding
        war on land; (b) with the object of preventing idleness on the part of
        persons capable of working, who are supported at public expense, and
        who have refused voluntary employment; (c) with the object of
        providing, in the absence of other means, for the existence of the
        population.</p>

        <p>Art. 18. Persons compelled to work under Article 17 must be
        employed, with the exception mentioned, in the locality of their
        domicile or in its immediate neighborhood. If for military or economic
        reasons an inhabitant has to be removed from his home in order to put
        him at work, this removal shall not in any case take him outside the
        occupied territory, nor shall it bring persons whose residence is more
        than thirty kilometers from the firing line within the limits of that
        zone.</p>

        <p>Suitable provision shall be made for housing and food for workers
        who shall receive fair remuneration, and, if need be, medical service.
        Besides rest periods and normal changes they shall be given permission
        as often as possible to visit their families, with whom they shall also
        be allowed to correspond and exchange parcels.</p>

        <p>Art. 19. Aside from the cases designated in Article 18, and aside
        from the case of a total or partial evacuation of a locality for
        military reasons, an inhabitant of occupied territory cannot be
        displaced from his home against his will, unless, because of his
        personal attitude, his presence endangers military security or public
        order.</p>

        <p>Art. 20. No civilian coming from one of the two States can in future
        be interned in the other State or in the occupied territories.
        Nevertheless, a civilian who, by reason of his personal attitude, and
        in the interest of military security or public order, has to be removed
        from his domicile in occupied territory, can be taken into the
        territory of the occupying State. The duration of his absence from
        occupied territory must be limited to a period of strict necessity and
        must not exceed six months, save in exceptional cases. At the
        expiration of this period the interested person is authorized to return
        to the occupied territory, unless the authorities should prefer to
        conduct him to the Swiss frontier.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The foregoing Franco-German agreement was entered into for an initial
    period of fifteen months, beginning May 15, 1918, and can be renewed for
    periods of three months each. A Belgo-German agreement of narrower scope
    was signed at Berne on March 22, 1918, relating only to civilian
    prisoners.</p>

    "Horrors_of_Austrian_Prisons"></a>Horrors of Austrian Prisons</h2>

    <h3>Inhuman Treatment of Civilian Women and Men at Internment Camps</h3>

    <p>A correspondent of The London Telegraph who spent three years in
    captivity in Austria has told of the horrible brutalities and cruelties
    suffered by interned aliens in that country. He states that there are both
    stations and camps for the interned prisoners, but the former are employed
    to exploit the captives; they are more livable than the horrible camps, but
    to live at a station one is charged three to ten times more for food and
    lodging than the current rates for citizens, and the prisoners suffer
    greatly for want of food and decent sanitation.</p>

    <p>He describes the experiences of prisoners at a place called Illmau, in
    lower Austria, as typical of Austrian methods. A party of Englishmen were
    taken there shortly after they had been arrested in Vienna. They were
    marched along for about twenty kilometers, carrying their bags or packages.
    It was very cold, below freezing point, and when at last they arrived at
    Illmau at dark they were pushed into a kind of cellar, three or four steps
    below the level of the ground. A soldier locked them in, telling them they
    could go there and die. It was a place with no windows—only a small hole

    floor. The floor, bare earth, was wet and muddy, water trickling down the
    walls. For every two men was one straw sack, also damp, of course, and they
    were so closely packed that they could not lie straight.</p>

    <p>During the day it was so dark that they could not see each other's
    faces. In the morning they were told that, if they wanted to wash, they
    might go to the pump from which they also got their drinking water. This
    pump stood in the middle of a manure heap, and could only be reached by
    wading knee deep through the liquid pool surrounding the manure heap. The
    quality of the drinking water can be rather imagined than described. The
    treatment was most rough; the only argument a guard ever used was the butt
    end of his rifle—if not the bayonet. Not many words were wasted on the
    "Schweine - Engländer," (Swine - English.)</p>

    <p>One day some high officials came to inspect Illmau, and after they had
    seen the above-ground portion, the Englishmen, who were shut up in their
    cellar, could hear them asking if no one was shut up in the cellars, as by
    rights they ought to inspect the cellars, too. But the guard officer
    assured them on his solemn word of honor that the cellars were empty. And
    those who were there did not dare to call out—they knew what their
    punishment would be—"stringing up" at least. This is an old punishment,
    where the wrists are fettered behind the back, a cord attached and passed
    through a ring in the wall over the prisoner's head. This cord is then
    pulled tight, till the man is forced right on to his toes. He is then kept
    so for about an hour, or till he faints. This was often done at Illmau.</p>

    <p>After the Englishmen had been in their wet cellar for a week, and were
    nearly all ill with the terrible cold, they were told they could go into an
    upstairs room. These rooms were occupied by Serbs and Poles, nearly all
    very ill with consumption and very dirty. Each man received a blanket of a
    kind of checked pattern. When these blankets were hung up in the yard to
    air it was impossible to recognize their pattern—they were all a crawling
    mass. The room into which the Englishmen were put was so full that when
    they lay down at night they were almost one on the top of the other. The
    consumptives were always expectorating, and "sanitary arrangements" were
    unknown.</p>

    <p>Drosendorf was a camp where, especially during the first months,
    prisoners endured the greatest hardships. They slept in sheds, in stables,
    sometimes on wet straw, sometimes without, and were treated as brutally as
    in other camps. "Here were also some women," says the correspondent, "and a
    lady I knew personally. When the latter was brought there with other
    prisoners, male and female, after walking for miles, they were shut into a
    large room—men and women together. There the 'sanitary arrangements'
    consisted of a large pail put down in the middle of the room. This lady was
    kept in this room with the men for some days, and not allowed to leave it.
    In this camp at present there are principally Russians, and rarely a day
    passes that a death does not occur from starvation. Here, as also in the
    large camp of Katzenau, the rations are as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Breakfast.—Tea made of a mixture of dried birch and strawberry
        leaves, and sixty grams (about two ounces) of bread.</p>

        <p>Midday.—Soup made of turnips, or potatoes boiled and served in the
        water they are boiled in, (no salt or fat,) and another sixty grams of
        bread.</p>

        <p>Evening.—Same as breakfast. At some places the same vessels are used
        for washing the floors and for boiling the soup.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Estergom in Hungary was at the beginning a much dreaded place. It is
    surrounded on three sides by the Danube and barbed wire on the fourth. At
    the beginning there were over 30,000 prisoners—men, women, and
    children—there, but not sufficient accommodation, so many spent the nights
    out of doors in the rain and endless mud. Some lived in tents. Of course
    striking a match in the dark was strictly forbidden, and when once some one
    did strike one, the guards rushed in, striking about them blindly with
    their fixed bayonets. Once one unfortunate Scotchman was attacked very
    badly with dysentery in the middle of the night, and came out to ask the
    guard to take him to a doctor. The guard simply<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_99" name="Page_99">[Pg 99]</a></span> ordered him to go back to the
    tent and be quiet. When the sick man begged again, the guard knocked him
    down with the butt end of his rifle.</p>

    <p>One camp, which was even lately mentioned as a disgrace in the Austrian
    Parliament, is Thalerhof, near Graz, the capital of Styria. Here they kept
    principally their own refugees from Galicia.</p>

    <p>The London Telegraph correspondent writes of Thalerhof:</p>

    <p>"One Polish lady who had been there for eight months is now in Raabs.
    She was taken away from her own house in Galicia in the clothes she stood
    in, allowed to take nothing with her. Eventually she reached Thalerhof.
    Through her sufferings there the poor woman is so broken down that it is
    almost impossible to get her to speak of what she has been through. A
    little she told me. When they—she and other ladies, priests, peasants, men
    of all classes—were brought to Thalerhof, the ladies (not the peasant
    women) were told they must come and bathe. It was many degrees below
    freezing point, but they were taken to a shed, open all round, down the
    middle of which a long row of troughs half filled with dirty water was
    arranged. The water had already been used by soldiers for washing their
    clothes. Then they were ordered to undress.</p>

    <p>"The soldiers with fixed bayonets surrounded these ladies, while they
    completely undressed in the open, and forced them to bathe in the troughs,
    threatening them with fixed bayonets all the time and torturing them with
    coarse jokes. The low-class women were left quiet, not forced to bathe like
    this. After the bath was over they were shut up in a room crowded with
    people full of vermin. The ladies were always chosen for the dirty
    work—never the peasant women, just as the priests were set to clear up the
    'sanitary arrangements,' which there consisted of a long open ditch with a
    board along one side of it.</p>

    <h3><a id="CIVILIANS_KIDNAPPED" name="CIVILIANS_KIDNAPPED"></a>CIVILIANS
    KIDNAPPED</h3>

    <p>"At the beginning they had a cruel way of arresting people. They would
    march them off as they stood, not letting them communicate with wives or
    friends or relatives. I know of one lady who for about two months did not
    know where her husband was, while he knew just as little about her. Two
    Serbian ladies, mother and daughter, who had also been at Salzerbad, had
    been staying at a little watering place in Dalmatia, where they had gone
    for many years. One evening, when they were only dressed in cotton dressing
    gowns, they were asked by an official to come down to a steamer lying at
    the wharf. Only for a few minutes, he said; there were just a few questions
    to be asked. So they went just as they were, and went on the boat with
    several others; some one began to ask them questions, when, to their
    horror, they noticed the ship was moving. They were taken right away, as
    they were. At every port they stopped and brought in others in the same
    way.</p>

    <p>"In Fiume they landed, were handcuffed two and two, and marched through
    the streets to the prison. There the daughter and her 65-year-old mother,
    who had been also handcuffed, spent the night in a cell, with only two
    upright chairs in it. Next day they and all the other prisoners collected
    up to then were packed into third-class carriages, packed as close as they
    would go, and in each compartment two soldiers, fully accoutred, with fixed
    bayonets, and smoking like chimneys. Although it was hot Summer, all the
    windows were kept shut. In this way they were brought to Marburg—a journey
    of some four or five hours in ordinary time—but they took two days for it.
    All this time they had nothing to eat. People came to the train selling
    things; but, as all their money had been taken away from them on the boat,
    they could get nothing. In Marburg they were put in the prison, and kept
    there for eight months."</p>

    <p>Quartermaster Sergeant T. Duggan of the First Coldstream Guards, who was
    at the prison camp at Schneidemühl (Posen) from 1914 to March, 1918,
    described the horrors at that camp as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Prisoners of all nationalities, Russians, French, British, and
        Belgians, were kept there, the majority being Russians. At the
        beginning they lived in holes in the ground without any covering
        whatever. Quartermaster Sergeant Duggan showed me a photograph
        illustrating this condition of things, which lasted for some time, it
        being a month before the prisoners had any covering over their heads.
        The food was so bad that the British could never eat it.</p>

        <p>About December, 1914, a typhus epidemic began. It continued for four
        or five months. Schneidemühl has one camp divided into three
        inclosures, the whole camp containing about 40,000 prisoners. The daily
        average of deaths was certainly not under thirty. Another photograph
        was shown to me depicting a long procession of coffins during the
        epidemic. A gigantic German carrying a rifle headed the procession,
        which was mainly composed of unfortunate Russian prisoners. Anything
        more pathetic cannot be imagined. Photographs were also shown me of the
        actual funeral service and place of interment. These photographs showed
        many being buried at one time in one long trench. After the interment,
        where the bodies were deposited four deep, one above another, the
        Germans made mounds surmounted by crosses, intimating that only two
        persons were buried beneath each mound.</p>

        <p>It is impossible to estimate now how many were buried altogether,
        but many thousands died from this typhus epidemic. When the epidemic
        broke out a terrible condition of affairs quickly ensued, and it was
        not until it had been raging for a fortnight that Russian doctors
        arrived on the scene. Some of the patients were then first sent to
        hospital. The camp's condition, even after the doctors' arrival, was
        perfectly awful.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>A British merchant Captain, who was released in May from internment in a
    German camp, asserted under oath that after his ship was torpedoed he was
    locked up for twenty-four hours in the U-boat for refusing to answer
    questions. On the following day he was searched, and for still refusing to
    answer was sentenced to be shot on reaching port, or before if he should
    cause any annoyance. One of the principal officers called him a liar and an
    English swine.</p>

    <p>Some days later the submarine put into Heligoland, and the Captain was
    transferred to an underground cell ashore. Later, after scanty and bad food
    had made him ill, he was marched with other prisoners from merchant ships
    to a camp. Kept naked in intense cold for three hours while his clothes
    were being searched, German officers stood about laughing. His garments
    were returned to him wet, and he was put in barracks, where his only
    covering was verminous blankets.</p>

    <p>In another compound the conditions were better, but the food uneatable.
    The prisoners were skeletons in rags. If they fell down from weakness they
    were kicked and clubbed, beaten with the flat of swords, and kept standing
    at attention in freezing weather. They had to fight like wild beasts for
    food that a dog would refuse. Funerals were a daily occurrence.</p>

    <p>Transferred to Brandenburg, where he lived five and a half months, the
    fare was such that, by the time his own parcels of food arrived, he had
    lost twenty-eight pounds in weight. Twenty degrees of frost have been
    registered on the inside wall of the barrack in the mornings, and in Summer
    the heat was intolerable and the flies and mosquitos very trying.
    Sanitation was almost nil; 850 Russians died at that camp earlier in the
    war, and several were burned to death there shortly before the Captain
    arrived.</p>

    <h3>Wonderful Work That Italy Is Doing to Render Maimed Men
    Self-Supporting</h3>

    <p class="center" style="font-weight: bold">By PROFESSOR RICCARDO
    GALEAZZI</p>

    <p class="center">[Lieutenant Colonel Italian Royal Medical Corps]</p>

    <p><i>Professor Galeazzi is at the head of the Milan Institute for the
    After-Care of Disabled Soldiers. The article herewith presented is
    published by</i> <span class="smcap">Current History Magazine</span> <i>by
    arrangement with The London Chronicle.</i></p>

    <p>Our idea is that the future prospects of a disabled soldier must not be
    built upon his assurance of obtaining a pension, but upon the rebuilding of
    him physically, and the retraining of him technically, to take up a
    self-supporting position in life.</p>

    <p>Therefore, there must be no scrapping of the broken soldier. When we
    bring him from the battlefield, and find that a limb or limbs have to be
    amputated, the soldier thus wounded is placed in a special category, and we
    cannot discharge him from the army until every care has been taken to
    rebuild him physically, morally, and professionally. Then, having given him
    his limbs and his re-education gratuitously, we also give him gratuitously
    whatever implements or machinery may be necessary for him to practice his
    new trade. Not until then do we put him on his new road of life.</p>

    <p>The organization for the different stages of this treatment is
    interesting. In Italy each army corps has its special province or district.
    And each of those geographical sections has a complete organization for the
    care of the disabled. There is the surgical hospital, the orthopedic
    institute, and the school for retraining the soldier in whatever trade he
    may be capable of following.</p>

    <p>When the amputation wound is sufficiently healed in the surgical
    hospital, we give the soldier a month's leave, fitting him with a temporary
    limb for use during that time. When the month is out—that is, before he has
    had time to get into lazy habits at home or suffer from the effects of
    misdirected sympathy—he must enter the school for the re-education
    disabled. To this school is also attached the orthopedic institution. Here
    he has his definite set of limbs fitted. A plaster cast is taken and each
    limb is made with particular individual care; and during the first weeks of
    its use the soldier is under the constant supervision of the doctors, so
    that they can alter the artificial limbs according as any defects become
    manifest.</p>

    <p>I may also say, for it is an important point, that the limbs made for
    the common soldier are the same as those made for the Colonel, and the one
    gets them gratis just as the other does. Not only that, but we have a
    National Institute whose duty is to take care of these limbs, renew them
    and alter them free of cost, as long as the soldier lives.</p>

    <p>What are the limbs like? Well, for instance, even where a man has lost
    both hands, we have fitted artificial ones which enable him to write with
    pen or pencil, to use knife and fork, to button his clothes, and to shave
    with a safety razor. Thus we get rid of the constant depression from which
    a soldier would otherwise suffer were he to feel dependent upon some friend
    for every hand's turn in his daily life.</p>

    <p>One of the great sources of success in applying these limbs is the
    special Italian system, the theory of which was laid down by Vanghetti, of
    making the amputation so that the muscles from the living part of the arm
    can be attached in such a way to the artificial limb as to get an organic
    muscular connection. Thus the natural muscles of the living arm actually
    can be got to work the artificial fingers or leg, as the case may be. I
    have made several of these connections<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_102" name="Page_102">[Pg 102]</a></span> full success. And the system
    is now becoming almost the rule all over the country. It is a special
    Italian invention, though some of the German professors want to claim the
    credit for it.</p>

    <p>The most important feature, however, of our Italian system is the
    insistence on retraining. If the soldier's disablement does not allow him
    to follow his ordinary calling in life, and if he be not of independent
    means, he is absolutely bound to spend at least a month or six weeks in the
    training school. There he is asked to choose a trade or calling in keeping
    with his physical ability. We keep him for at least about six weeks, and
    show him the whole system in working order. Of course, if he cannot be
    persuaded, we must allow him to go home, for, after all, we are a free
    country. But when he remains he is put through a thorough course of
    training.</p>

    <p>During these first weeks in the school the new limbs are fitted, for the
    school works in connection with the orthopedic institute. In the school we
    teach the illiterate peasants to read and write. We teach all sorts of
    designing and drawing, all commercial subjects, all the artisan trades, and
    also technical farming. Generally we give preference to these trades that
    can be practiced at home; and we do not encourage largely such trades as
    would call for work in large factories. In the case of farmers or farm
    laborers, who are too seriously injured to undertake the heavy work in the
    fields, we teach them the finer technique of vine culture, wine making,
    cheese making, &amp;c.</p>

    <p>And it generally happens that these disabled men return to life better
    fitted for their work than they were before the war.</p>

    <h2><a id="Sneezing_Powder_in_Gas_Attacks" name=
    "Sneezing_Powder_in_Gas_Attacks"></a>Sneezing Powder in Gas Attacks</h2>

    <p>A report from a correspondent on the Picardy front, dated May 6, 1918,
    described how the Germans launched a heavy gas attack against the
    Americans, sending over within a short period 15,000 shells, containing
    chiefly mustard gas. This attack was notable for a new German device, which
    is described as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The Germans introduced gas warfare, forcing modern soldiers to wear
        gas masks. Now after the use of masks has proved an effective weapon
        against gas they are using a new weapon to force the allied soldiers to
        take off masks that they may be easily killed by lethal phosgine and
        diphosgine gases.</p>

        <p>The weapon is nothing more or less than sneezing powder fired in
        high explosive shells. This powder percolates through mask respirators
        and brings on sneezing spells which lead the men to take off their
        masks and to receive the full effect of lethal gases. It has been used
        against the Americans. The method in use is to fire a number of
        sneezing powder shells just before a gas attack or to scatter them
        along among lethal gas shells.</p>

        <p>The German now uses his gases in four methods: First, clouds, which
        depend on a favorable wind; second, projectors, also depending on the
        wind; third, long-range artillery gas shells, and, fourth, hand
        grenades. Deadly gases, such as phosgine and diphosgine, are used in
        short-range guns, while neutralization gas, intended only to prevent
        activities of allied soldiers far back of the lines, is used at long
        range. Mustard gas is much used in this way. The latest perfection in
        the use of lethal gases is to fire twelve or more mortars shooting
        large-calibre shells at the same time by an electrical arrangement,
        thus producing great concentration.</p>

    </a>A Month's Events Amid the Chaos Produced by Bolshevist Misrule and
    German Invasion</h3>

    <p>The State Department at Washington on May 16, 1918, published the text
    of a protest to Germany made by the Russian Government on April 26. The
    document opened with the following statement: "The Russian Government has
    taken every measure possible strictly to fulfill the Brest- Litovsk treaty
    from the Russian side, and in this way to secure for our people the chief
    aim of this treaty—a state of peace. But in reality no such state of peace
    exists." The message then enumerated the grievances of the Russians. It
    pointed out that by advancing upon Kursk and Voronezh the German and
    Ukrainian troops infringed the Russo-Ukrainian frontier line, "which was
    one-sidedly established by the Ukrainian Rada itself, and officially made
    known to us by the German Government." At the same time, the protest said,
    Russian military property in Finland was being seized by the White Guards,
    operating in agreement with German detachments and under instruction from
    the German staff.</p>

    <p>The document also called attention to the fact that, although the Soviet
    authorities had declared their readiness to open peace negotiations with
    the Ukrainian Central Rada, neither the Ukrainian Government, "which is now
    directed by Germany," nor the Berlin Government itself, had given any
    answer to the Russian offer. "Owing to such circumstances," the message
    declared, "the Soviet Government considers itself compelled to mobilize all
    necessary forces in order to secure the freedom and independence of the
    Russian Republic, which is now menaced beyond the limits established by the
    Brest-Litovsk treaty." The document concluded by reiterating the complete
    readiness of the Russian people to fulfill the conditions of the
    Brest-Litovsk pact, and by demanding the German Government should formulate
    the new demands, "in the name of which it directs Ukrainian, Finnish, and
    German troops against the Russian Soviet Government."</p>

    <h3><a id="GERMAN_PROMISES" name="GERMAN_PROMISES"></a>GERMAN PROMISES</h3>

    <p>In response to this protest, Berlin, on May 13, advised the Soviet
    Government through the Russian Ambassador in Berlin, that Germany would
    stop the invasion of Russian territory, and that it would observe the
    Brest-Litovsk treaty and restore the rights of Russians residing in
    Germany. In spite of this assurance, however, the advance of the German
    Army in Great Russia did not cease. According to a Moscow dispatch, dated
    May 25, the Germans occupied the district town of Valuyki, in the
    Government of Voronezh, which is Great Russian territory, and made further
    advances. The occupation was preceded by a battle which lasted four days.
    The Teutons also continued their operations in the Don region, where a
    battle occurred near Bataisk, and in the Caucasus. They mined the Strait of
    Kerch, or Yenikal, known to the ancients as the Cymmerian Bosporus, which
    is the only passage from the Black Sea into the Sea of Azov. German
    airships appeared over Novorossysk, on the Black Sea coast of the Caucasus,
    and their submarines entered its port. This was done apparently to
    intimidate the Transcaucasian Government, which refused to cede Novorossysk
    to Turkey. About the same time Bolshevist detachments crossed the Caspian,
    attacked the Turks and recaptured the port of Baku. Another battle was won
    by the Russians over the Turco-German troops in the Kars district of
    Transcaucasia on May 24. The enemy retreated along the Ardahan road,
    massacring the population as they went.</p>

    <p>Early in June the Germans made a <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_104"
    name="Page_104">[Pg 104]</a></span>further advance in the south, namely, in
    the Roslav region and in the district of Rylsk, Government of Kursk. They
    advanced from the Rostov Railway toward Voronezh and captured Roventki.
    They also made an attempt to cut the Tsaratsyk Railway near the Kumyigar
    River. On June 10 the Germans started a new movement eastward along a front
    sixty miles wide, between Valyiki, captured previously, and Zhukovo.</p>

    <h3><a id="BLACK_SEA_FLEET" name="BLACK_SEA_FLEET"></a>BLACK SEA FLEET</h3>

    <p>A large part of the Russian Black Sea fleet fell into the hands of the
    Germans when they captured Sebastopol, but two large ships and two
    destroyers escaped. A telegram to the Berliner Tageblatt, dated May 12,
    said that the majority of the captured vessels had been so neglected that
    only two battleships were in good condition. One dreadnought and four
    cruisers had previously been captured at Odessa. On June 6, the Moscow
    Government offered to surrender the Black Sea fleet to Germany on the
    following conditions: 1. The ships to be restored after the war is over. 2.
    Germany to refrain from using the vessels. 3. Invasion of Russia to
    stop.</p>

    <p>According to a memorandum sent on May 21 by Foreign Minister Tchitcherin
    to the Bolshevist Ambassador Joffe in Berlin, Russian merchantmen and even
    a hospital ship were attacked by the Germans in the Black Sea, and the
    menace of German attack constituted a serious obstacle to navigation in the
    Baltic and Arctic.</p>

    <p>On June 6, Germany delivered an ultimatum to the Soviet Government,
    demanding the return of the remainder of the Russian Black Sea Fleet from
    Novorossysk to Sebastopol, as a condition for the cessation of hostilities
    on the part of the Central Powers. The Commissary for Foreign Affairs
    expressed himself in favor of acceding to the demand, and Lenine ordered
    the surrender of the ships.</p>

    <p>The Soviet Government had no illusions as to the stability of the
    Brest-Litovsk peace, but in its opinion the time for a new clash with the
    Central Powers was not yet ripe. Consequently, in the of German aggression,
    it pursued a policy of preserving this "bad peace" by all manner of
    concessions and compromises.</p>

    <p>The tasks which the Soviet Government were facing were outlined by
    Nikolai Lenine in several speeches made before the Central Executive
    Committee of the Councils, in the middle of May. His words were to the
    effect that war was threatening the Soviet Republic from many quarters.
    Either of the belligerent groups of imperialistic powers might, in his
    opinion, at any moment attack Russia. The ambitions of Skoropadsky and of
    the new Caucasian Government, which was under the influence of German
    militarism, was regarded as another source of danger. "We shall do the
    little we can," said Lenine, "all that diplomacy can do to put off the
    moment of attack. * * * We shall not defend the secret agreements which we
    have published to the world; we shall not defend a 'Great Power,' for there
    is nothing of Russia left but Great Russia, and no national interests,
    because for us the interests of the world's socialism stand higher than
    national interests. We stand for the defense of the socialistic
    fatherland."</p>

    <p>Lenine professed belief that this defense was facilitated by the
    profound schism which divided the capitalistic Governments, by the fact
    that "the German bandits" were pitted against "the English bandits," and
    that there were economic rivalries between the American bourgeoisie and the
    Japanese bourgeoisie. "The situation is," said Lenine, "that the stormy
    waves of imperialistic reaction, which seem ready any moment to drown the
    little island of the Soviet Socialist Republic, are broken one against
    another." It was his intention to take full advantage of this situation,
    and to keep Russia out of the war for as long a time as possible, with a
    view to curing her economic wounds and building up her military power for
    the coming clash with world capitalism. Economic recuperation, in the
    largest sense of the word, was thus declared to be the immediate problem of
    the revolution. The expropriation of capital became a matter of
    <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_105" name="Page_105">[Pg
    105]</a></span>secondary importance in comparison with the task of
    consolidating the gains of the proletariat and putting them to good use.
    "We have accomplished two tasks," said Lenine in concluding his speech
    before the Central Executive Committee on May 16. "We have seized the
    power, and we have divided it among all Russia. We point to the realization
    of the third and most difficult task, namely, the disciplining of the
    proletariat to such a degree that every corner of Russia shall be permeated
    thereby."</p>

    <h3><a id="NO_PEACE_WITH_UKRAINE" name="NO_PEACE_WITH_UKRAINE"></a>NO PEACE
    WITH UKRAINE</h3>

    <p>The Bolshevist Government made efforts to come to terms with the
    Ukraine, and also with Finland. In the middle of May a Russian peace
    delegation arrived in Kiev. Germany appointed Baron Mumm von
    Schwarzenstein, Ambassador to the Ukraine, as its representative to the
    peace conferences, with almost dictatorial powers, especially in questions
    relating to boundaries. The efforts of the Soviet Government to make peace
    with the Ukraine remained ineffectual. The delegates were unable to agree
    regarding the frontier line. Repatriation of Ukrainians living in Great
    Russia was another stumbling block. The removal of property by repatriated
    Ukrainians, it was objected, would conflict with the Soviet regulation
    allowing only small sums of money to be exported from Russia. Besides, said
    the Bolsheviki, this would give propertied Russians a simple means of
    escape from the Soviet Republic.</p>

    <p>According to a London dispatch, dated June 7, Germany was responsible
    for the delay in the negotiations. The German command at Kiev was reported
    to have declared Russo-Ukrainian peace inopportune before all important
    points in the Ukraine were occupied.</p>

    <p>It was reported on June 10 that Germany and Russia had entered into an
    agreement under which Finland ceded to Russia the fortresses of Ino and
    Raivola, with the understanding that they were not to be fortified, while
    Russia surrendered to Finland a part of the Murman Peninsula, with an
    outlet to the ocean, thus bringing German influence to Russia's arctic
    ports and to the railroads connecting them with the interior of the
    country.</p>

    <h3><a id="INTERNAL_CONDITIONS" name="INTERNAL_CONDITIONS"></a>INTERNAL
    CONDITIONS</h3>

    <p>Upon the whole, conditions in Russia showed no signs of improvement.
    Famine existed in Petrograd and in other, particularly urban, districts of
    Great Russia, while civil war was still raging in Siberia and in some parts
    of European Russia. According to information made public by the State
    Department at Washington on May 21, cholera broke out in Astrakhan and in
    the Caspian Sea region. Observers of Russian life also noted the growing
    moral laxity of the population and its complete indifference to public
    affairs.</p>

    <p>Reports from Eastern and Central Russia indicated that in many districts
    less than half the usual acreage was plowed. This was attributed to the
    shortage of seed, horses, and implements. Even where seed was available the
    peasants, uncertain of the disposition of the land and the crops, did not
    plant extensively. Breadstuffs were scarce even in grain centres, and
    prices were very high. The attitude of the farmers to the city people
    continued to be one of distrust and hostility, and the exodus of the city
    dwellers into the country continued.</p>

    <p>A recent article in Maxim Gorky's daily Novaia Zhizn (New Life) speaks
    of the conditions prevailing in the Russian village in the following
    terms:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>All those who have studied the Russian village of our days clearly
        perceive that the process of demoralization and decay is going on there
        with remarkable speed. The peasants have taken away the land from its
        owners, divided it among themselves, and destroyed the agricultural
        implements. And they are getting ready to engage in a bloody
        internecine struggle for the division of the booty. In certain
        districts the population has consumed the entire grain supply,
        including the seed. In other districts the peasants are hiding their
        grain underground, for fear of being forced to share it with starving
        neighbors. This situation cannot fail to lead to chaos, destruction,
        and murder.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The article gives also a glimpse of what is going on in the remnants of
    the Russian Army:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>There are numerous reports to the effect<span class="pagenum"><a id=
        "Page_106" name="Page_106">[Pg 106]</a></span> that the soldiers are
        dividing among themselves the military property of the country and
        committing unspeakable acts of violence. Wild rumors are current about
        the troops returning from Asia Minor. It is said that they have brought
        with them into the Crimea a large number of "white slaves" and that
        there is in Theodosia a veritable slave market. The supply is so great
        that the price has fallen from 100 or 150 rubles to 15 or 30 rubles
        apiece.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="RUSSIA_A_MADHOUSE" name="RUSSIA_A_MADHOUSE"></a>RUSSIA A
    MADHOUSE</h3>

    <p>A terrible picture of the chaos in Russia is given by an educated woman
    in Petrograd, the daughter of a Russian diplomat formerly in Washington,
    and the widow of an officer in the Russian Army. To a former classmate in
    the United States she wrote:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It was bad enough before the March revolution, when our unhappy,
        half-witted Emperor, under the influence of his German wife, seemed to
        do everything possible to make people lose patience. But now we have a
        thousand anonymous potentates, the top ones paid by Germany, and the
        lower ones lured into supporting them by money, money, and money.</p>

        <p>The present Government has abolished all laws, all courts, the
        police, land ownership, all private real estate in towns, all
        distinction of castes and grades in the army and navy. They have seized
        all the banks, are opening all the private safes, and confiscating all
        gold and silver found therein, though it had never been said before
        that it was criminal to have it. Of course, everything they "decree" is
        so mad that it is quite sure not to last forever, but the chaos they
        make will take centuries to forget. The country is going back to a
        savage state. And we will not live to wait for better times.</p>

        <p>All Russia is suffocating—every day brings new surprises that show
        that there is but one way out of it—the grave. On the ground of liberty
        they abolish all laws, Judges, attorneys, and substitute for it
        "people's courts of justice," with only soldiers, workmen or peasants,
        often quite illiterate and always without the slightest knowledge of
        court proceedings, taking the places of the former judiciary.</p>

        <p>On the same ground they abolish all police, let loose all the
        criminals from the prisons, arm them, constituting from their number,
        together with workmen, deserters and hooligans, a "red guard," and fill
        the prisons to their utmost with all those who crave for order and will
        not work together with them toward the total ruin of the country.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>On the pretense of equality they abolish all grades in the army and navy
    and make all posts elective by the simple soldiers. In most places it is
    understood as complete extermination, lynching of the officers, who, for
    being better educated, are under suspicion of being
    "counter-revolutionary." The highest posts are occupied by elected soldiers
    who very often can hardly sign their names, and the former officers are
    made simple soldiers, with a soldier's pay of $3.50 a month, and ordered to
    the lowest tasks, cleaning of the barracks, cooking food, taking care of
    the horses.</p>

    <p>Our great country could only exist when all the wheels of the Government
    were working in harmony. Now everything is a perfect chaos. Everybody was
    willing to throw over the Czaristic Government, but not in order to change
    it for this one, of loot, anarchy, and treason toward our allies! Ah, the
    shame, the disgrace, and the folly of it!</p>

    <h3><a id="LOOTING_AND_DESTROYING" name=
    "LOOTING_AND_DESTROYING"></a>LOOTING AND DESTROYING</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The army, which now consists of young boys, (the regular one is long
        ago killed,) without any sense of duty, morals, and discipline, see
        their acquired "freedom" in the freedom to go home when they want to.
        And so all the trains, all the stations, are attacked and destroyed by
        this horde of savages, who kill engineers, if it seems to them the
        train goes too slowly, who martyrize the railway agents who tell them
        of the impossibility of starting their train, for there is another one
        coming toward them on the same track. As this human flood goes home
        without any organization, everything is looted and destroyed.</p>

        <p>Some months ago I was believing myself to be quite well off. I have
        a house in Petrograd. Last Spring I was offered $125,000 for it, but
        was advised not to sell and go over to America to have my little girl
        become a happy American school girl. Now—I have on hand about $2,000
        and no other resources; the house, like other private property, is
        being confiscated, the revenue going to the Government, that is to say,
        to the private pockets of the usurpers. The Government bonds annulated
        (repudiated)—and even if I had more money—believe me—there is nothing
        to buy.</p>

        <p>Life in Petrograd is horrible—all the criminals, all the workmen,
        and demoralized soldiers rob the few cars that still bring some kind of
        products. In the very heart of the city, in daytime, you have your
        clothes taken off your back literally. Just think that there is no
        police, nobody to call for help, for those who would like to help have
        had their firearms confiscated, even the officers, even the highest
        Generals. All the soldiers, &amp;c., are armed<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_107" name="Page_107">[Pg 107]</a></span> them to
        come into your private lodging and, under the pretense of
        "perquisition," take away all your money and valuables.</p>

        <p>Our money is not accepted anywhere abroad. Russia is bankrupt, so
        that it is impossible to escape. All my friends and relatives are in
        the same awful position. Everybody lives on his last money, even those
        who were quite rich. Their money was in Government or private bonds,
        and, as they are declared void, where will you get money from? My poor
        mind cannot grasp the whole thing; it is too great a madness. My only
        chance to save my little girl's life and my own would be to get away
        from here and go to the United States. Here, if we do not die in the
        next months, we will be slaves, regular slaves, of our lowest
        classes.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="RAILROAD_SITUATION" name="RAILROAD_SITUATION"></a>RAILROAD
    SITUATION</h3>

    <p>Some light was shed on the railroad situation in Russia by the report
    made on June 2 to the Central Executive Committee of the Soviets by the
    Assistant Commissioner of Railroads. The percentage of disabled
    locomotives, he stated, was about 30, that of crippled cars being higher.
    In 1917 Russia had 560,000 cars and upward of 20,000 locomotives. The
    Germans seized a large number of cars and locomotives. Nevertheless, there
    was no scarcity of rolling stock, for the mileage had been reduced from
    45,000 to 35,000. The general conclusion of the report was that the
    situation had slightly improved, especially in Siberia.</p>

    <p>On April 22, Leon Trotzky made a report to the Central Executive
    Committee of the Soviets on the newly organized Russian Army. He defended
    the employment of officers of the old army on the ground that they were
    just as valuable as the military property taken over by the Soviet
    Government, and pointed out the eventual necessity of conscription.
    According to a London dispatch, dated June 8, the Soviet Government decided
    to introduce conscription. "One of the most promising things," said a
    Bolshevist diplomat in an interview on June 5, "is the steady growth of the
    new Red army. Its discipline already is better than that of the old one.
    Its members have so far been recruited from town and factory workers. * * *
    We take measures to provide for military training in villages and towns and
    all necessary steps toward raising the fighting capacity of our new army,
    which already is by no means negligible."</p>

    <h3><a id="BOLSHEVIKI_AND_THE_JEWS" name=
    "BOLSHEVIKI_AND_THE_JEWS"></a>BOLSHEVIKI AND THE JEWS</h3>

    <p>A statement bearing on the situation of the Russian Jews under the
    Bolshevist régime was issued by the celebrated Russian jurist and former
    Senator, Oscar Grusenberg, and made public on June 10. The document
    follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Those who think that the Jews are at present ruling Russia are
        profoundly mistaken. The new laws, or rather administrative
        regulations, which the Bolsheviki have promulgated, have hurt the
        Jewish population more than other citizens, for the Bolshevist
        legislation has ruined the commerce and industry of the country.</p>

        <p>After the Bolshevist insurrection we lived through events similar to
        those of October, 1905. In October, 1917, pogroms occurred in 200
        Jewish towns and hamlets.</p>

        <p>The tragedy of the Jews in Russia is heart-breaking. The united
        Russian Jewry, counting upward of 6,000,000, exists no longer. With the
        secession of the Ukraine, Lithuania, and Poland, the number of Jews in
        Russia is reduced to a million and a half. The situation of the Jews in
        the Ukraine, and particularly in Poland and Lithuania, under German
        domination, is very sad. The Jews have lost in this war, in killed and
        wounded, the majority of their youth. A great many Jewish soldiers are
        pining in prison camps, others are locked up in jails on slanderous
        charges of treason.</p>

        <p>The Jews are almost the only nationality in Russia which, by every
        means available, is seeking to arrest the process of splitting up the
        Russian Empire, and which works for the reunion of the portions that
        have seceded.</p>

        <p>Hundreds of thousands of Russian Jews were ruined at the moment when
        the Bolsheviki took over the Governmental power. The population visited
        its wrath on the Jews, because some of the Bolshevist leaders are or
        are said to be Jews. But the Russian Empire has been demoralized, not
        by the Jews, but by the old régime. Russia lacks great leaders with
        heroic characters, who know how to act in an hour of distress. This
        made possible the triumph of men like Lenine and Trotzky.</p>

        <p>The Jewish leaders of the Bolsheviki are themselves a product of the
        old régime. Czarism persecuted and exiled them. Education they were
        forced to seek <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_108" name=
        "Page_108">[Pg 108]</a></span>abroad, and there, in foreign lands, they
        lost all connection with and love for Judaism and Russia. Every country
        is to them but a railroad station. It is these former Jews and present
        Bolshevists that are responsible for the appalling misery which has
        befallen the Russian Jews.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="ANTI-BOLSHEVIST_MOVEMENTS" name=
    "ANTI-BOLSHEVIST_MOVEMENTS"></a>ANTI-BOLSHEVIST MOVEMENTS</h3>

    <p>An official French dispatch received in Washington on May 16 asserted
    that the opposition to the Soviet régime was growing stronger. On June 2 a
    Russian wireless message announced the discovery of a vast
    counter-revolutionary conspiracy, with ramifications throughout the
    country. Moscow was declared in a state of siege, a large number of persons
    were arrested, and stringent measures were taken to restrain the press.
    Boris Savinkov, Chief of the War Department under Kerensky, and Prince
    Kropotkin, the famous revolutionist and writer, were reported to have taken
    part in the conspiracy. A week later a Moscow dispatch reported that
    factory workers were boycotting Soviet delegates, that some provincial
    towns elected anti-Bolshevist Deputies to the Soviets, and that a general
    political strike appeared imminent.</p>

    <p>In the middle of May the Central Committee of the Russian Social
    Revolutionary Party addressed to the National Council of the French
    Socialist Party and to the Parliamentary Socialist group the following
    message:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The Bolshevist Government, which exists but by the grace of our
        German masters, assumes, under the pressure of Germany's Ambassador, a
        provoking attitude toward the allied powers, and particularly toward
        France, addressing to them insulting ultimatums which are in striking
        contrast with the servile docility they manifest in executing the
        orders of German imperialism. The Russian Social Revolutionary Party
        sends its socialist greetings to the French section of the Labor
        International, and protests against the spirit of the foreign policy of
        the present dictators of Russia.</p>

        <p>The Social Revolutionary Party declares at the same time that the
        newly formed Communist group, formerly Bolsheviki, must on all accounts
        be excluded from the International for having called upon the most
        elementary principles of democracy to resuscitate forms of despotism
        and violence. They have betrayed the cause of international socialism
        by an infamous separate peace with the crowned despots of Central
        Europe, transforming Russia, disarmed, humiliated, and crushed, into an
        administrative supply house destined to sustain the German offensive in
        the west.</p>

        <p>The Social Revolutionary Party expresses the hope that all the
        national sections of the Labor International will determine their
        attitude as regards the Bolshevist usurpers, taking into consideration
        this declaration of our party, which itself has the right to speak for
        all Russian labor, having held an absolute majority in the
        Constitutional Convention, whose powers will be resuscitated in spite
        of the sanguinary repressions made by the usurpers of power. We beg our
        French comrades to send this declaration to the Socialist parties of
        the allied countries.</p>

    <h3><a id="FIGHTING_IN_SIBERIA" name="FIGHTING_IN_SIBERIA"></a>FIGHTING IN
    SIBERIA</h3>

    <p>Armed opposition to the Soviet Government was confined chiefly to
    Eastern Siberia. In the first week of June clashes occurred in
    Transbaikalia between the Government troops and the anti-Bolshevist forces
    led by General Semenoff. The Soviet troops were apparently mastering the
    situation. It was reported that they included armed Teuton prisoners, and
    that General Semenoff was expecting Japanese reinforcements. The other
    leaders of anti-Bolshevist forces, Admiral Kolchak, Colonel Orloff, and
    General Kalmakoff, co-operated in protecting the railways and massed their
    troops, which include Russians and Chinese, for an offensive. The Soviet
    Government repeatedly protested to China against the assistance it had
    given to General Semenoff, requesting that the Chinese Government should
    either close the Manchurian frontier to the General's forces or permit the
    Bolshevist troops to cross into Manchuria and subdue the rebel. On May 25
    Ambassador Francis published a statement from Secretary Lansing to the
    effect that American Consuls had given no aid to General Semenoff, or any
    other anti-Bolshevist leader. The message contained an assurance of "the
    friendly purposes of the United States toward Russia, which will remain
    unaltered so long as Russia does not willingly accept autocratic domination
    by the Central Powers."</p>

    <p>Late in May a new Government appeared<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_109" name="Page_109">[Pg 109]</a></span> the south of Russia. It
    claimed to represent the regions of Don, Kuban, Terek, Astrakhan, and
    Northern Caucasus, and was emphatically Bolshevist in its orientation. It
    was headed by a dictator, General Krasnoff, who had served under Kerensky
    up to the fall of the Provisional Government. His manifesto declared that
    the Don Government was a sovereign State, at war with the Soviet Republic,
    and on friendly terms with the Ukraine. This manifesto contained the
    following statement: "Yesterday's foreign foes, the Austro-Germans, have
    entered our territory in alliance with us to fight against the Red Guard
    and for the establishment of order on the Don."</p>

    <p>Another anti-Bolshevist Government was formed, early in June, in Eastern
    Siberia. The new State, which proclaimed itself an independent republic,
    purported to include the entire territory stretching from Lake Baikal to
    the Pacific, as well as the district of Irkutsk and the Island of Sakhalin,
    comprising a population of 2,500,000.</p>

    <p>Violent clashes occurred between the Soviet forces and the Czechoslovak
    troops, which had joined the Russian Army to fight for the allied cause.
    The Czechoslovaks defeated the Soviet army, which was trying to enforce
    Trotzky's order to disarm them, seized the railway stations at Penza, on
    the Volga, in an effort to force their way to Vladivostok, and penetrated
    into the Ural region.</p>

    <p>During the month under record Germany made further steps in pursuance of
    her policy of subjugating the <i>membra disjecta</i> of the former Russian
    imperium.</p>

    <p>On May 13 it was reported that Berlin planned to turn Lithuania into a
    "semi-federal" German State. The next day Emperor William issued a
    proclamation declaring Lithuania a free and independent State, on the basis
    of the action of the Lithuanian Landsrat, which, on Dec. 12, 1917, had
    announced "the restoration of Lithuania as an independent State, allied to
    the German Empire by an eternal, steadfast alliance, and by conventions
    chiefly regarding military matters, traffic, customs, and coinage, and
    solicited the help of the German Empire." The declaration assumed that
    Lithuania would "participate in the war burdens of Germany, which secured
    her liberation." According to information made public by the State
    Department at Washington, the Germans were forcing the Lithuanian peasants
    to work for the landowners at a starvation wage and were taking stringent
    measures against city workers.</p>

    <p>Similar conditions prevailed in Livonia. A message sent on May 21 by
    Tchitcherin to Ambassador Joffe stated that the Germans had created a reign
    of terror there, persecuting labor and assisting the Barons in suppressing
    their political adversaries.</p>

    <p>In the Ukraine the Germans disarmed the troops of the overthrown Rada
    and backed Skoropadsky's dictatorial régime with bayonets. Sporadic
    uprisings of peasants against the Teutons continued. In the Province of
    Kiev the Germans used gas bombs against several revolted villages, and
    whole communities were asphyxiated. Revolts also broke out in the
    Governments of Podolia and Poltava. Resistance was offered mainly in
    connection with German food requisitioning. It was reported that the
    Germans had twelve army corps in the Ukraine. In the middle of May the
    Central Powers granted a loan of 4,000,000 marks to the Ukraine.</p>

    <h3><a id="GERMAN_ATROCITIES" name="GERMAN_ATROCITIES"></a>GERMAN
    ATROCITIES</h3>

    <p>The German atrocities in White Russia are thus described in a Russian
    Government dispatch received in London on May 14:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In the Bobrinsk district entire villages have been set afire and
        plundered. In the village of Buda a Uhlan patrol extorted a
        contribution of several thousand rubles, and, when the peasants had
        paid part of it and were unable to pay more, the Uhlans surrounded the
        village and bombarded it.</p>

        <p>In other villages peasants, women, and children who endeavored to
        escape from fires were pursued by Uhlans and cut to pieces with swords
        or flogged with whips. In one village an old Jew was first flogged and
        then hanged in the presence of all the villagers. Most savage acts were
        perpetrated in Jewish villages. All <span class="pagenum"><a id=
        "Page_110" name="Page_110">[Pg 110]</a></span>persons suspected of
        belonging to the Bolsheviki and those in military uniforms were
        immediately shot.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In Finland the Germans helped the White Guards to suppress the
    revolution, and strengthened their grip on the country. Some of the
    captured Red Guards were shot—7,000 were reported executed on June 6—others
    were to appear before twenty-one specially created courts. The reprisals of
    the White Guards were directed particularly against the Russians in
    Finland. A Russian wireless, dated May 14, contained the following
    statements: "Even 12-year-old children have been shot. At Viborg one
    witness saw 200 corpses, mainly Russian officers and mere schoolboys.
    According to other witnesses, more than 600 persons were executed in two
    days." The German headquarters in Finland estimated the number of persons
    massacred at 70,000. The Finnish High Court of Justice ordered the arrest
    of all Socialist members of the Finnish Diet. In contravention of the
    Brest-Litovsk treaty, the German commander demanded the control of the
    Russian war supplies at Helsingfors, which were valued at 150,000,000
    rubles.</p>

    <p>On June 12 the Finnish Government introduced into the Diet a bill
    providing for the establishment of a monarchic form of government in
    Finland. The Finnish King, who is to be a hereditary ruler, shall be
    invested with broad powers regarding treaties with foreign States, and
    shall have the absolute veto in several important matters.</p>

    <p>The new Finnish Government is emphatically pro-German. This was
    illustrated by the membership of the new Cabinet formed by Paaskivi. There
    were signs, however, that anti-German sentiment was developing among the
    masses of the people. General Mannerheim, Commander of the White Guard,
    resigned late in May, apparently as a protest against the Germanization of
    the Finnish Army. This army is now commanded by German officers. The
    Germans also took over the control of the Finnish Military College, and
    undertook to organize the Finnish coast fleet. They are constructing two
    railways in Northern Finland.</p>

    <p>In the middle of May the White Russian Republic was proclaimed with the
    consent of Germany. The new Government seemed to favor a union with
    Lithuania, under the military protectorate of Germany. On June 4 it was
    reported that the new republic had been recognized by the Ukraine.</p>

    <p>Early in May the Tartar National Council met at Bakhchisaray, Crimea,
    and issued a statement protesting against the entrance of the Austro-German
    troops into the Crimea. The council declared that the Crimea, whose
    population is 70 per cent. Tartar, intends to maintain its complete
    independence till conditions in Russia grow more settled.</p>

    <p>According to a London dispatch, dated June 7, fierce fighting was going
    on between the troops of the Caucasian Government and the Turks. These are
    reported to have massacred 10,000 Armenians in a fortnight. The Government
    had ordered the mobilization of all men between the ages of 19 and 42.</p>

    <h3><a id="ALLIED_INTERVENTION" name="ALLIED_INTERVENTION"></a>ALLIED
    INTERVENTION</h3>

    <p>The subject of allied military intervention in Russia for the purpose of
    freeing the country from German domination attracted a great deal of
    attention in June. The allied Governments did not define their attitude
    toward this matter, but it seemed certain that the United States did not
    favor sending an interallied military expedition into Russia. Japan
    refrained from any action in this direction. The only measure it took was
    to enter into an agreement with China for the protection of the general
    peace in the Orient from possible German and Bolshevist aggression. The
    principal clauses of the military treaty between China and Japan, signed
    May 16, 1918, are in substance as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The two Governments, with a view to warding off the danger
        constituted for them by the penetration of German influence toward the
        eastern frontier of Russia, have decided to regulate their conduct in
        regard to the enemy by placing themselves in agreement on a footing of
        perfect equality, and in according each other mutual aid in that region
        where their common action is to be exercised.</p>

        <p>The Chinese authorities will facilitate the task of the Japanese
        authorities, who will be enabled to conduct the transport<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_111" name="Page_111">[Pg 111]</a></span> of
        troops and establish in the occupied territories works which shall be
        removed at the conclusion of military operations, and, moreover,
        undertake to supply war material and munitions, as well as engineers
        and a medical staff and other necessary specialists.</p>

        <p>The Japanese must in return respect Chinese sovereignty and local
        customs, and will evacuate Chinese territory as soon as the operations
        are terminated. The agreement will automatically cease to be valid as
        soon as the state of war between the two contracting parties and the
        Central Powers is terminated.</p>

        <p>One article of the agreement provides that Chinese troops may be
        employed outside the national territory, and another stipulates that
        the two Governments shall come to an understanding with the Chinese
        Eastern Railway Company if this railway should have to be used during
        the course of the operations.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="RUSSIAN_OPINION" name="RUSSIAN_OPINION"></a>RUSSIAN OPINION</h3>

    <p>In Russia proper the Soviet authorities and radical public opinion
    opposed foreign intervention of any kind. Late in May the official
    Bolshevist organ printed an article asserting that Russia desired from the
    Allies no help intended to drag her back into the war, but that Russia
    would appreciate in the highest degree any assistance toward the
    improvement of transportation and communication facilities and the
    rehabilitation of her economic life." Even the moderate press found foreign
    military intervention undesirable. The Moscow Prizyv, the official organ of
    the Social Revolutionaries, however, declared editorially that "the
    intervention of the Allies alone can give us the real military strength and
    indispensable support for thrusting back the yoke of the German, and for
    reconstituting Russia." On June 11, Boris Bakhmeteff, the Russian
    Ambassador at Washington, transmitted to the State Department a resolution
    adopted by the Central Committee of the Constitutional Democrats, (also
    known as Cadets,) the Russian Liberal Party. The resolution pointed out
    that the Cadet Party did not recognize the Brest peace, and looked to the
    Allies for the amelioration of Russian conditions. The statement
    emphatically denied the assertion that the Russian democracy was opposed to
    allied aid. It insisted, however, that the success of the action would
    depend upon "the support of national feeling in Russia." The resolution
    concluded: "It is further imperative for Russian public opinion to receive
    assurances that the expedition will be co-ordinated with the inviolability
    of the rights and interests of Russia, and that the actions of all the
    Allies on Russian territory will be performed under international
    control."</p>

    <h3><a id="SENATOR_KINGS_RESOLUTION" name=
    "SENATOR_KINGS_RESOLUTION"></a>SENATOR KING'S RESOLUTION</h3>

    <p>On June 10 a resolution favoring intervention in Russia was offered in
    the Senate by Senator King of Utah. It was referred to the Committee on
    Foreign Relations. The full text of the resolution follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Whereas, The people of Russia after centuries of political servitude
        are finally about to realize their aspirations for liberty and the
        constitution of a federal republic; and,</p>

        <p>Whereas, The innate sense of justice, desire for public order, and
        the community life of the Russian people promise a sound moral basis
        for the institutions of liberty and the equal rights of men under the
        law as incorporated in a republican form of government; and,</p>

        <p>Whereas, It is the traditional policy and the interest of the United
        States of America to promote and protect the progress of liberty and
        the principles of democracy as incorporated in republican institutions;
        and,</p>

        <p>Whereas, The people and the Government of the United States hailed
        with great and sincere good-will the prospects for the establishment of
        these principles in the great domains of Russia for the permanent
        welfare, political dignity, and beneficence of the Russian people;
        and,</p>

        <p>Whereas, The Imperial Government of Germany, by intrigues and
        propaganda, and in perfidious violation of the pretended peace with
        Russia, designs to destroy the Government of Russia and the unity and
        nationality of the Russian people, and for this purpose is attempting
        to separate Russia into small vassal States in order to more
        effectually bring the people, territory, and resources of Russia within
        the German power; and,</p>

        <p>Whereas, In the pursuit of this perfidious purpose, Germany is now
        subjecting Russia to industrial and economic servitude, and is
        attempting to recruit troops from among the people of Russia to
        replenish her depleted armies, and to promote her felonious purpose in
        the world; and,</p>

        <p>Whereas, The Russian people desire to establish a republican form of
        Government<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_112" name="Page_112">[Pg
        112]</a></span> and are in sympathy with the cause of the United States
        of America and of the Allies, and would welcome assistance in
        neutralizing German intrigue and propaganda, and in repelling the
        intrusion of German power; and,</p>

        <p>Whereas, German troops are now operating in Russia and are making
        advances, with a view to taking possession of Russian territory,
        including Siberia, and subjecting the same to political domination and
        industrial servitude; and,</p>

        <p>Whereas, The cause of the Allies and the principles for which they
        wage war are thus placed in jeopardy; now, therefore, be it</p>

        <p>Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate of the United States
        that a commission be sent to Russia to co-operate with the American
        Ambassador and other representatives of our Government to overcome and
        neutralize German propaganda in Russia and to aid in Russia's economic,
        industrial, and political freedom; and be it</p>

        <p>Further Resolved, That it is the sense of the Senate of the United
        States that a military expedition be organized and sent by the United
        States of America, in conjunction with the Allies, including Japan and
        China, to co-operate with the armies of the Russian people to repel the
        advance of German arms and to expel from Russia German military power
        and establish therein the authority of the people and Government of
        Russia.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The policy of the Washington Government in June remained one of
    nonintervention in Russia, but there was a strongly representative and
    widely increasing public opinion that the United States should join with
    Japan, China, and the Allies to aid Russia and prevent further German
    penetration. This sentiment was especially outspoken and vigorous in the
    West and on the Pacific slope, where previously anti-Japanese and
    anti-Chinese prejudices had predominated.</p>

    <h3><a id="INTERVENTION_URGED" name="INTERVENTION_URGED"></a>INTERVENTION
    URGED</h3>

    <p>A Supreme Council was held at Tokio June 7, attended by Prince Fushimi,
    Field Marshals Yamagata and Terauchi, (the Premier,) and Lieut. Gen.
    Oshima, the Minister of War. A joint conference of the Field Marshals and
    the Admirals was summoned for June 10.</p>

    <p>The Entente Governments of Europe were declared in a Tokio dispatch
    dated June 15 to be bringing increasing influence to bear to induce Japan
    to intervene in Russia. Among the several French officers who arrived in
    Tokio to consult with the General Staff was Major Pichon, who was head of
    the French military mission to Russia, and whose recall was demanded by the
    Bolsheviki. Major Pichon was reported to be striving for intervention in
    Siberia as a military necessity with the same energy that he opposed
    Rumania's entrance into the war as an ill-advised step. Major Pichon
    formerly was Military Attaché at Bucharest. The partisans of intervention
    were finding support from A. I. Konovaloff, formerly Minister of Trade and
    Industry in the Russian Provincial Government, and especially from Jules
    Destrée, who was appointed Belgian Minister to Petrograd in August, 1917.
    M. Destrée, who is a Socialist, arrived in <a id="Japan" name=
    "Japan"></a>Japan after vainly seeking to return to Europe across
    Finland.</p>

    <p>"It is urgently imperative for the defense of the interests of the
    Entente that there shall be a liberation of the Russian people from
    Germanic domination," M. Destrée declared. "The Trans-Siberian Railroad is
    the only remaining communication with the outside world, and this could be
    destroyed at any time by the German prisoners, of whom there are 20,000
    under arms in Siberia. I saw armed Germans at every station, ostensibly
    allies of the Bolsheviki. The destruction of the Trans-Siberian Railroad
    would mean the complete abandonment of Russia to the Teutons."</p>

    <h3><a id="CZECHS_IN_SIBERIA" name="CZECHS_IN_SIBERIA"></a>CZECHS IN
    SIBERIA</h3>

    <p>It was reported on June 15 that the Czechoslovak troops operating
    against the Russian Soviet Government in Siberia and the Ural region
    continued their successes. During the 9th and 10th of June, having occupied
    Samara, they advanced rapidly toward Ouffa.</p>

    <p>On the Siberian railroad from Theliabinsk to Tomsk (a distance of 1,250
    miles) all the towns were reported to be in the hands of the Czechoslovaks.
    Omsk was occupied on June 8 by a united force of Slavs and Cossack peasants
    under command of Colonel Ivanoff, the Soviet forces having retired from
    Omsk and Tunen.</p>

    <p>The new Siberian Government established<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_113" name="Page_113">[Pg 113]</a></span> the Omsk-Nicholaevsk region
    notified the Soviet Government at Moscow of the abolition of the government
    of soldiers and deputies in Siberia and of the creation of the new
    Provisional Government. The notification stated that the Siberian
    Government, which is joined by Commander Ivanoff in the forwarding of
    communication, does not intend to work for the separation of Siberia from
    Russia, and is ready to negotiate for a supply of provisions to the
    northern district of Russia.</p>

    <p>Should the Council of Commissioners at Moscow, however, attempt to
    re-establish the Soviet power in Siberia, it was declared, the Siberian
    Government would resist and would discontinue the sending of bread grains
    to Northern Russia.</p>

    "Letters_From_Trotzky_and_From_Kerenskys_War_Minister"></a>Letters From
    Trotzky and From Kerensky's War Minister</h2>

    <p>Two letters from Russian officials, very different in contents but both
    of historical significance, were brought to the outside world by Herman
    Bernstein, who had been sent to Petrograd by The New York Herald. One is a
    confidential letter from Trotzky to Lenine, written at Brest-Litovsk at the
    end of the peace conference, as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It is impossible to sign their peace. They have already agreed with
        fictitious Governments of Poland, Lithuania, Courland, and others
        concerning territorial concessions, military and customs treaties, in
        view of self-determination. These provinces, according to the German
        interpretation, are already independent German States, and as
        independent States have already concluded territorial and other
        agreements with Germany and Austria-Hungary. Today I put these
        questions squarely and received a reply leaving no room for
        misunderstandings. Everything was stenographed. Tomorrow we shall
        present the same questions in writing. We cannot sign their peace.</p>

        <p>My plan is this: We announce the termination of the war and
        demobilization without signing any peace. We declare we cannot
        participate in the looting war of the Allies nor a looting peace.
        Poland's, Lithuania's, Courland's fate we place upon the responsibility
        of the German working people. The Germans will be unable to attack us
        after we declare the war ended. At any rate, it would be very difficult
        for Germany to attack us because of her internal conditions. The
        Scheidemannists adopted a formal resolution to break with a Government
        that makes annexationist demands of the Russian revolution. The
        Berliner Tageblatt and the Vossische Zeitung demand an understanding
        with Russia by all means; Centrists favor an agreement. Internal strife
        is demoralizing the Government, a bitter controversy is raging in the
        press about the struggle on the western front; we declare that we end
        the war, but do not sign peace.</p>

        <p>They will be unable to make an offensive against us.
        Verteidigungskrieg. If they attack us our position will be no worse
        than now, when they have the opportunity to declare us agents of
        England and Wilson, after his speech and comments on attack. I must
        have your decision. We could well drag negotiations one, two, three, or
        four days; afterward they must be broken off. I see no other solution
        than that proposed.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>I clasp your hand.</p>

    <p><span style="margin-left: 29.5em;">Your TROTZKY.</span><br /></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Answer by direct wire: "I agree to your plan" or "I do not
        agree."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This letter is in accordance with the published circumstances. Trotzky
    apparently endeavored to persuade Lenine that if Russia should declare the
    war at an end, while refusing to sign a formal peace, the Germans would not
    attack. They, on the contrary, attacked at once, and Trotzky collapsed.
    History must determine whether he was honestly mistaken or was merely
    seeking a means of "saving his face," while acting in the German
    interest.</p>

    <h3><a id="FROM_BORIS_SAVINKOV" name="FROM_BORIS_SAVINKOV"></a>FROM BORIS
    SAVINKOV</h3>

    <p>The other letter is by Boris Savinkov, Kerensky's Minister of War, and
    for many years a leader in the terrorist wing of the Social Revolutionary
    Party. It was published last April in the Russky Viedomosti. The Lenine
    Government promptly suppressed it and confiscated the paper, but Mr.
    Bernstein succeeded in smuggling a copy out of Russia. It reads as
    follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>We are vibrating with indignation at the Bolshevist decrees and
        their ignominious peace. We feel ourselves humiliated <span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_114" name="Page_114">[Pg 114]</a></span>and
        disgraced. We are mercilessly handed over "Kamerad" to any one.
        Nevertheless, we are doing nothing, because we do not even venture to
        say, "God be praised, it was not we but our neighbor who was shot." Yet
        we shall never forget that Lenine, Nathanson and company arrived in
        Russia via Berlin. The German Government helped them. The gift demands
        a gift in return. Lenine and his satellites have repaid Germany
        handsomely, first through the subsidized journal Pravda, next by the
        naked front, then by Brest-Litovsk, and finally by an incredible
        peace.</p>

        <p>What have they done with my Russia? It is necessary to be a fanatic
        or a paid agent to be able seriously to maintain that the international
        proletariat would help us. Only criminals and lunatics could base a
        political computation upon such support when Lenine and his co-adjutors
        entirely destroyed Russia's former means and power. The Germans lifted
        the mailed fist and Lenine instantly gave way, but others commenced
        howling about the necessity to defend the fatherland, not only my
        Russia, but the newly invented fatherland. Who can believe the men who
        destroyed the army and declared that the idea of fatherland is a
        prejudice? Who can believe that they would defend Russia? They are
        impotent. Nor do I believe that they are sincere. The Soviet admitted
        that the declaration of Lenine was right that we Russians ought to put
        up with the loss of Finland, Esthonia, Livonia, Courland, White Russia,
        Lithuania, Ukraine, and part of the Caucasus districts. The rights of
        Russia exist no longer. There are only separated towns and villages,
        economically dependent upon foreigners. The position of Russia is like
        that of Poland after the partition. Has not William realized his dream?
        Have not the People's Commissaries deserved the Iron Cross?</p>

        <p>The Bolsheviki have served Germany and serve Germany still. It is no
        secret that Russia is covered with a net of German organizations, and
        that the Russians who are wishing for the restoration of the monarchy
        are working hand in hand with the Germans. It is no secret that many
        Russians dream of the day on which the Germans will enter Petrograd and
        German policemen appear in the Nevsky Prospekt. They prefer the devil
        himself to the Bolsheviki. What have they done with my Russia?</p>

        <p>The Bolsheviki are our national misfortune, but Russia must be
        saved, not by our enemies, not by German bayonets, but by ourselves. We
        Russians must again be masters of Russia. It must never be said that we
        are weak without the imperial assistance of William and are unable to
        organize a State. It was not to reach this goal that we sacrificed
        streams of Russian blood throughout three years, nor was it in order to
        follow the program of the Bolsheviki or to stretch out our hand toward
        the enemy. As sure as it is treason against Russia to compromise with
        the Bolsheviki, so sure is the agreement with Germany under which we
        are now living worse treason against Russia. We must not forget that
        the Russian Nation does not die. Sooner or later it will dawn upon the
        people of Russia what my Russia ought to be, and the treason will never
        be pardoned. It is an aberration to believe that Nicholas will be able
        to return. But when will my Russia stand forth again vigorous and free?
        I only know one thing. I learned when young: Through work and fight
        thou shalt win thy right. We must work and fight against the Germans
        and the Bolsheviki.</p>

    <p>After the revolution of March, 1917, had achieved what terrorism had
    been powerless to accomplish, M. Savinkov threw himself heart and soul into
    the task of saving the army. He realized more clearly than did any of his
    revolutionary associates, Kerensky included, that a surrender to the
    Germans with the Socialists in power would inevitably compromise the
    Socialist cause in Russia. As Chief Commissioner of the Coalition
    Government with the armies of the southwestern front he strongly supported
    General Korniloff in taking stern measures to restore discipline. Kerensky
    quarreled with Savinkov because the latter, becoming Minister of War,
    continued to support General Korniloff. Savinkov is a comparatively young
    man, of great determination and resource. He is well known as a writer.</p>

    <h3>Project for a South Slavic State, Aided by the Czechs, Threatens to
    Disrupt Austria-Hungary</h3>

    <p>Of the many internal troubles tending toward the disintegration of the
    Austro-Hungarian Empire the one that has grown most rapidly in the last
    year is the Jugoslav movement—the movement for an independent State to be
    known as Jugoslavia, and to include all the Southern Slavic provinces of
    Austria-Hungary, as well as Serbia and Montenegro in the Balkans. This
    project assumed a new phase in May, 1918, when it received the active
    support of the millions of Czechs in Bohemia, Austria's northwest border
    province. The Czech demand for a free Bohemia and Jugoslavia helped to
    precipitate a political crisis at Vienna, which Emperor Charles met by
    summarily suppressing Parliament. All indications pointed to the existence
    of a united effort of the Slavs, Czechs, Slovaks, Poles, Ukrainians,
    Croatians, and Italians to throw off the Teutonic yoke, completely
    dismembering the Austro-Hungarian Empire.</p>

    <p><a id="The_only_session_of_the_Reichsrat" name=
    "The_only_session_of_the_Reichsrat"></a>The only session of the Reichsrat
    that has been held in Austria-Hungary since the war began was opened on May
    31, 1917, and closed abruptly by imperial order on May 4, 1918. Throughout
    that period the Slavic Deputies in the lower house showed increasing
    hostility to the war methods and plans of the Teutonic minority which rules
    the empire. The house consisted of 516 members, of whom only 233 were
    Germans. The dominant nationality has for years managed to keep its control
    of the Reichsrat through alliance with the Poles, who hold 80 or 90 seats,
    but in the Spring of 1918 the Poles broke away from the Germans, and
    suddenly the Government discovered that it was in a minority and that its
    war budgets were in serious danger of being defeated. Then it resorted to
    the drastic measure of adjourning Parliament under threat of force.</p>

    <p>Already the Czechs, Slovaks, and Jugoslavs been working together in
    Parliament, generally getting the support of the Ruthenians (Ukrainians)
    and the Italians. In the closing months of 1917 this tendency was
    accentuated, when the Polish leaders came into closer alliance with the
    Czecho-Slovaks and Jugoslavs. This was cemented by a congress of Czech
    Deputies, held in Prague on Jan. 6, 1918, which adopted unanimously the
    declaration given below. The document was at first suppressed by the
    Austro-Hungarian censor, and the few publications that got hold of it were
    not allowed to leave the country.</p>

    <h3><a id="THE_CZECH_DECLARATION" name="THE_CZECH_DECLARATION"></a>THE
    CZECH DECLARATION</h3>

    <p>Despite this attempt at suppression the text of the document reached the
    outside world through the Czecho-Slovak National Council. It is as
    follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>In the fourth year of this terrible war, which has already cost the
        nations numberless sacrifices in blood and treasure, the first peace
        efforts have been inaugurated. We, the Czech members of the Austrian
        Reichsrat, which, through the verdicts of incompetent military
        tribunals, has been deprived of a number of its Slav Deputies and Czech
        Deputies to the dissolved and as yet unsummoned Diet of the Kingdom of
        Bohemia, and to the equally unsummoned Diets of Moravia and Silesia,
        recognize the declarations of the Czech Deputies in the Reichsrat, and
        deem it our duty emphatically to declare, in the name of the Czech
        Nation and of its oppressed and forcibly silenced Slovak branch of
        Hungary, our attitude toward the reconstruction of international
        relations.</p>

        <p>When the Czech Deputies of our regenerated nation expressed
        themselves during the Franco-Prussian war on the international European
        problems they solemnly declared in their memorandum of Dec. 8, 1870,
        that "all nations, great or small, have an equal right to
        self-determination, and their complete equality should always be
        respected. Only from the recognition of the equality of all nations and
        from mutual respect of the right of self-determination can come true
        equality and fraternity, a general peace and true humanity."</p>

        <p>Also the new Russia accepted the principle of self-determination of
        nations during its attempts for a general peace as a fundamental
        condition of peace. The nations were freely to determine their fate and

    INDEPENDENCE</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>On the other hand, the Austro-Hungarian delegate declared, in the
        name of the Quadruple Alliance, that the question of the
        self-determination of those nations which have not hitherto enjoyed
        political independence should be solved in a constitutional manner
        within the existing State. In view of this declaration we deem it our
        duty to declare, in the name of the Czecho-Slovak Nation, that this
        point of view of the Austro-Hungarian representative is not our point
        of view. On the contrary, we have in all our declarations and proposals
        opposed this solution, because we know, from our own numberless bitter
        experiences, that it means nothing but the negation of the principle of
        self-determination. We indignantly express our regret that our nation
        was deprived of its political independence and of the right of
        self-determination, and that by means of artificial electoral statutes
        we were left to the mercy of the German minority and of the Government
        of the centralized German bureaucracy.</p>

        <p>Our brother Slovaks became the victims of Magyar brutality and of
        unspeakable violence in a State which, notwithstanding all its apparent
        constitutional liberties, remains the darkest corner of Europe, and in
        which the non-Magyars, who form the majority of the population, are
        ruthlessly oppressed by the ruling minority, extirpated, denationalized
        from childhood, unrepresented in Parliament and civil service, deprived
        of public schools, as well as of all private educational
        institutions.</p>

        <p>The Constitution, to which the Austro-Hungarian representative
        refers, falsified even the justice of the general suffrage by an
        artificial creation of an over-representation of the German minority in
        the Reichsrat, and its utter uselessness for the liberty of nations was
        clearly demonstrated during the three years of unscrupulous military
        absolutism during this war. Every reference to this Constitution,
        therefore, means, in reality, only a repudiation of the right of
        self-determination for the non-German nations of Austria who are at the
        mercy of the Germans; and it means an especially cruel insult and
        injury to the non-Magyar nations in Hungary, where the Constitution
        <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_117" name="Page_117">[Pg
        117]</a></span>is nothing but a means of shameful domination by the
        oligarchy of a few Magyar aristocratic families, as was again proved by
        the recent electoral reform proposal.</p>

    <h3><a id="SELF-DETERMINATION" name=

    <blockquote>
        <p>Our nation longs with all the democracies of the world for a general
        and lasting peace. But our nation is fully aware that no peace can be
        permanent except a peace which will abolish old injustice, brutal
        force, and the predominance of arms, as well as the predominance of
        States and nations over other nations, and which will assure a free
        development to all nations, great or small, and which will liberate
        especially those nations which still are suffering under foreign
        domination. That is why it is necessary that this right of free
        national development and to self-determination of nations, great or
        small, to whatever State they may belong, should become the foundation
        of future international right, a guarantee of peace, and of a friendly
        co-operation of nations, as well as a great ideal which will liberate
        humanity from the terrible horrors of a world war.</p>

        <p>We, deputies of the Czech nation, declare that a peace which would
        not bring our nation full liberty could not be and would not mean a
        peace to us, but only a beginning of a new, desperate, and continuous
        struggle for our political independence, in which our nation would
        strain to the utmost its material and moral forces. And in that
        uncompromising struggle it would never relax until its aim had been
        achieved. Our nation asks for independence on the ground of its
        historic rights, and is imbued with the fervent desire to contribute
        toward the new development of humanity on the basis of liberty and
        fraternity in a free competition with other free nations which our
        nation hopes to accomplish in a sovereign, equal, democratic, and
        socially just State of its own, built upon the equality of all its
        citizens within the historic boundaries of the Bohemian lands and of
        Slovakia, guaranteeing full and equal national rights to all
        minorities.</p>

        <p>Guided by these principles, we solemnly protest against the
        rejection of the right of self-determination at the peace negotiations,
        and demand that, in the sense of this right, all nations, including,
        therefore, also the Czecho-Slovaks, be guaranteed participation and
        full freedom of defending their rights at the Peace Conference.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="WAGRAM_GATHERING" name="WAGRAM_GATHERING"></a>WAGRAM
    GATHERING</h3>

    <p>On March 2 a gathering of Jugoslavs met at Zagrub (Wagram) which
    included the Jugoslav Deputies of the Reichsrat, practically the entire
    membership of the Croatian Sabor, (the Legislature which exercises a
    limited amount of local autonomy,) and other representatives of the nation.
    According to the Hrvatska Drzhava, extracts from whose accounts have been
    translated by the Serbian Press Bureau in Geneva, they contained the
    following statement:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>After having discussed the general political and national situation
        the assembly has agreed on the necessity of a concentration of all
        parties and groups which, from the point of view of national
        self-government, demand the creation of a national and independent
        States of Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs founded on the principle of
        democracy.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The language of this passage parallels the Declaration of Corfu, by
    which exiled leaders of the Jugoslav movement demanded the union of the
    Jugoslav territories in Austria-Hungary with Serbia and Montenegro into one
    kingdom under the Karageorgevitch dynasty. Austrian papers at once became
    agitated because there was no reference to the carrying out of this aim
    within the framework of the Hapsburg Empire. The fact that many, if not
    most, of those present were known to be in accord with the Declaration of
    Corfu, and the suspicion that practically all of them favored it at heart,
    caused many protests against the "introduction of the policy of Belgrade"
    in the Viennese press.</p>

    <p>The matter was further complicated by the activity of the police in the
    affair, they having broken up the first session of the assembly and posted
    a guard around the hall. Demonstrations of the students against this, which
    seem to have gone no further than parading up and down the streets singing
    Slavic national songs, were broken up by the police with the utmost
    violence, and many were arrested.</p>

    <p>This did not prevent a large gathering, principally of students, at the
    station the next day to bid farewell to Dr. Koroshetz, leader of the
    Jugoslav Club in the Reichsrat. Dr. Koroshetz is taking the lead in the
    organization of a Jugoslav National Council of some twenty-four members,
    whose aims are euphemistically described for the present <span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_119" name="Page_119">[Pg 119]</a></span> as "to
    arrange the tactics of the general Jugoslav policy."</p>

    <p>The economic conditions which contribute to the revolutionary ferment in
    the Jugoslav countries were set forth in a speech in the Reichsrat in the
    course of a budget discussion just before this assembly by Dr. Matko
    Leginja, Deputy from Istria and Vice Chairman of the Jugoslav Club. He
    quoted the appeal from an Istrian commune which ended:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>We beg, ask, and demand bread, peace, and the return of our
        brethren, fathers, and sons to console us, to see that our fields are
        worked properly, and that there should be some one with us to close the
        eyes of the dying parents.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Of many instances of starvation which he gave was one of a parish in
    which in 1912 there were 67 births and 23 deaths. In 1917 there were 23
    births and 68 deaths, without counting those who died in military
    service.</p>

    <h3><a id="CONFERENCE_AT_ROME" name="CONFERENCE_AT_ROME"></a>CONFERENCE AT
    ROME</h3>

    <p>The significance of the whole movement was deepened by the Conference of
    Oppressed Austrian Nationalities held at Rome on April 10, when a full
    understanding with Italy was reached. The territorial and other questions
    at issue between the Italians and Jugoslavs were settled, and the Poles
    joined the other delegates in the demand for a complete overthrow of the
    present Austrian Empire, declaring that the future of Poland lay in a firm
    alliance with the reconstituted nations of the Czecho-Slovaks, the
    Jugoslavs, and the Rumanians. The text of the formal declaration then
    adopted, is as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>1. Every people proclaims it to be its right to determine its own
        nationality and national unity and complete independence.</p>

        <p>2. Every people knows that the Austro-Hungarian Monarchy is an
        instrument of German domination, and a fundamental obstacle to the
        realization of its rights to free development and self-government.</p>

        <p>3. The Congress recognizes the necessity of fighting against the
        common oppressors.</p>

        <p>The representatives of the Jugoslavs agree:</p>

        <p>That the unity and independence of the Jugoslav Nation is considered
        of vital importance by Italy.</p>

        <p>That the deliverance of the Adriatic Sea and its defense from any
        enemy is of capital interest to the two peoples.</p>

        <p>That territorial controversies will be amicably settled on the
        principle of nationality, and in such a manner as not to injure the
        vital interests of the two nations; interests which will be taken into
        account at the peace conferences.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Polish delegates added their declaration that they considered
    Germany to be Poland's chief enemy, and that they believed the
    disintegration of the Austro-Hungarian Empire to be indispensable for the
    obtaining of their independence from Germany.</p>

    <h3><a id="ITALYS_ACTIVE_HELP" name="ITALYS_ACTIVE_HELP"></a>ITALY'S ACTIVE
    HELP</h3>

    <p>As a result of this important conference, a separate section was
    established by the Italian Ministry of Foreign Affairs to look after the
    propaganda in favor of the Allies in the Austro-Hungarian countries and in
    their armies. The Austrian Premier, Dr. von Seidler, stated in his last
    speech before the adjourning of the Reichsrat that the Austro-Hungarian
    Government was fully aware of this propaganda and had taken measures to
    combat it. A Slovene paper, the Slovenic, commented as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The German newspapers have begun at the same time to call the
        attention of the Jugoslavs to Italian imperialistic aims and to show
        all at once great devotion to our country, which, they say, is menaced
        by the Italian peril. With a special affection for our people, an
        affection never known before, they urge us to beware of our Italian
        neighbors, enumerating all the points of the London understanding with
        regard to our territory.</p>

        <p>In publishing this agreement the Grazer Tagblatt, that ultra
        national German organ, wished to give us a political lesson of which
        they might have saved themselves the trouble. It was superfluous, if
        for no other reason, because it came from German nationalists, whose
        counsels we can never follow.</p>

        <p>The Austrian Government and the German newspapers are troubling
        themselves in vain as to how to circumvent the Italian propaganda. It
        would be of more importance if they would take care to improve their
        system of government, the oppression and injustice of which only help
        the work of the propaganda. (Further thirty lines censored.)</p>

    <h3><a id="PROTEST_IN_REICHSRAT" name="PROTEST_IN_REICHSRAT"></a>PROTEST IN
    REICHSRAT</h3>

    <p>The Czecho-Slovak Deputies in the Reichsrat introduced a motion on
    April<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_120" name="Page_120">[Pg
    120]</a></span> which was suppressed by the Vienna censorship. In the name
    of the Slovak Parliamentary Union, the motion, introduced by Deputy
    Kalinov, demanded that the Reichsrat refuse to sanction the imperial
    ordinance of May 1, 1915, which extended the age of service in the
    Landsturm from 43 to 50 years. The arguments presented in support of this
    demand, as summarized by a Berne correspondent of the Paris Temps,
    constitute a protest of all the Czecho-Slovak nations:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>1. Against the war.</p>

        <p>2. Against the militarism which, directed by the absolute will of
        the monarch, has enchained the free will of nations.</p>

        <p>3. Against the military tyranny that has installed itself in
        Bohemia, and which is militarizing every stratum of society.</p>

        <p>4. Against the spirit and tendencies of the army leaders, who have
        made of the army an instrument of Germanization and Magyarization.</p>

        <p>5. Against absolutism, because the law has been interpreted in an
        unconstitutional manner, without the consent of the Reichsrat.</p>

        <p>6. Against the dual system and the will for annexation, against
        peace based on violence, and, still more emphatically, against the
        shameful exploitation of Czecho-Slovak territory through requisitions
        and incessant contributions.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Czecho-Slovak Deputies added:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>An attempt is being made to starve our country, which was the
        granary of the whole Hapsburg Monarchy, and whose population, alike in
        villages and cities, is now suffering atrociously from famine and
        misery.</p>

        <p>Our declaration is, above all, a unanimous manifestation of the
        collective will of the nation. It proves:</p>

        <p>That the Czecho-Slovak Nation is firmly resolved to dispose
        henceforth of its own life and goods and children by the sole agency of

        <p>That our nation and, first and foremost, our women demand a general
        and just peace, which alone can bring liberty and independence to the
        nation, and which alone can cause justice to reign in the whole
        world.</p>

        <p>That we wish henceforth to live our own life in a State of our own,
        as a member of a society of free nations, a society that will solve
        without violence the questions that arise between peoples, depending
        upon a friendly understanding, and thus bringing happiness to liberated
        humanity.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>When the Austro-Hungarian Government under Premier von Seidler found
    itself confronted by a hostile Slavic majority in the Reichsrat,
    threatening the defeat of its war budgets, Emperor Charles empowered the
    Premier to "adjourn Parliament forthwith and inaugurate measures to render
    impossible the resumption of its activities." This was done on May 4. The
    Parliament had been composed of 233 Germans, 108 Czechs, 92 Poles, 33
    Ruthenians, 42 Jugoslavs, and 19 Italians. The Germans had considerably
    less than a majority.</p>

    <p>In another respect the suppression of Parliament was viewed as a
    concession to the Magyars. Those holding reign in Hungary since 1867 had
    been resentful at the claims of the Czechs and the Jugoslavs, fearing that
    the Government would be forced to make some concessions to them. If the
    project of unity were realized Hungary would be reduced to about half of
    its present size. On several occasions the Magyars had called on the
    Government at Vienna to suppress the Parliamentary agitation, threatening
    to form a separate Hungarian army and impose restrictions on the
    exportation of foodstuffs.</p>

    <p>The Government, in a public statement, ascribed its action to the food
    crisis, which was very acute, adding: "The Government will devote its
    entire strength to the economic problem and will try to create conditions
    required to enable the population to hold out."</p>

    <h3><a id="THE_PREMIERS_ADMISSION" name="THE_PREMIERS_ADMISSION"></a>THE
    PREMIER'S ADMISSION</h3>

    <p>A Vienna dispatch stated that the Premier, addressing a conference of
    party leaders, had demanded that the Parliamentary sittings be postponed,
    and added that, unless they took this step, the Government would prevent
    the sessions by force. In the debate that followed he had admitted the
    existence of many problems which must receive consideration, especially
    that of the agitation for a South Slavic State, but had added:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Discussion of this problem, however, is impossible at present,
        because it concerns not only Austria but also Hungary and Bosnia. But
        one thing is certain—if such a State were created it could be only
        under the sceptre of his Majesty, as a <span class="pagenum"><a id=
        "Page_121" name="Page_121">[Pg 121]</a></span>component part of the
        monarchy. It could not include those parts of Austrian territory which
        border on the Adriatic and are closely connected with districts where
        the German language is spoken. But national aspirations exist also in
        these districts, and it is only natural that the national wishes of the
        Southern Slavs be duly considered.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the course of discussion of the question of revising the Constitution
    on the basis of national autonomy, Premier von Seidler announced that in
    Bohemia the Government would speedily issue regulations providing for the
    appointment of administrators for districts inhabited by distinct
    nationalities. After sounding a warning against inciting nationalities
    against one another, he said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Our entire military and political situation has reached a climax.
        The next few months will bring a big decision. I am firmly convinced
        the decision on the battlefield will be in favor of Austria and her
        allies. Our economic, especially our food, conditions are very serious,
        but they are not at all desperate. To hold on now to a final happy
        decision is the vital question for the State. It therefore is necessary
        that, unhampered by Parliamentary confusion, the Government be left in
        a position to devote all its strength to these tasks.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="FOOD_SHORTAGE" name="FOOD_SHORTAGE"></a>FOOD SHORTAGE</h3>

    <p>The Austro-Hungarian Empire was at that time facing a dozen different
    crises, all aggravated by the problem of food. Even the racial animosities,
    always threatening to overturn the unstable rule of the German and Magyar
    minority over the Slavic majority, was inflamed into bitterness by
    sectional jealousies over food distribution. These crises reached a
    culmination in the decision of the Government to prorogue Parliament.</p>

    <p>What straits the empire had reached were partially revealed by the
    Premier's speech to the party leaders, and also by the German official
    statement that all food supplies from the Ukraine during the month of May
    would be given to Austria-Hungary, on account of its greater need. Still
    more significant was Dr. von Seidler's admission, made public on May 4,
    that Austria was unable to feed the populations of North Tyrol and Northern
    Bohemia, and that he had, therefore, consented that the former be attached
    for provisioning purposes to Bavaria, and the latter to Saxony. This
    concession, the dispatch added, had been wrung from him by leaders of the
    German parties after a conference lasting six hours. It meant that for food
    supply purposes these portions of Austria were being annexed to Germany.
    The Austrian Government yielded with the greatest reluctance, realizing
    that the political consequences might be far-reaching. It was pointed out
    that this would accentuate the feud between the German and non-German races
    in Austria-Hungary, since the provinces affected are German-speaking, and
    would strengthen the agitation for the incorporation of Austria into a
    German federation.</p>

    <p>The meeting of the German and Austrian Emperors at the German Great
    Headquarters on May 12 did not tend to allay fears of this nature. Though
    the results of the meeting remained secret, the belief was expressed in
    many quarters that it had constituted a formal acknowledgment of the
    subservient relations of Austria-Hungary toward the German Empire.</p>

    <h3><a id="MARTIAL_LAW_IN_PRAGUE" name="MARTIAL_LAW_IN_PRAGUE"></a>MARTIAL
    LAW IN PRAGUE</h3>

    <p>Shortly after the beginning of the war the Hungarian authorities
    suppressed the Slovak press almost in its entirety. Thus the Slovaks came
    to depend upon the Czech newspapers of Bohemia for their political and
    other information. On May 5 the Hungarian Government issued an order
    forbidding Czech newspapers from Bohemia and Moravia to circulate in
    Slovakia.</p>

    <p>The whole Czech and Slovak population, indeed, was seething with
    hostility to the Imperial Government and its war policies. Prague, the
    capital of Bohemia, had become a centre for leaders of the Czecho-Slovaks,
    Jugoslavs, and Poles in their agitation for independence. Demonstrations of
    an anti-German character became frequent, and Czechs and Jugoslavs paraded
    the streets shouting "Long live Wilson, Clemenceau, and Lloyd George!" The
    manifestations against the Austrian State began afresh on the evening of
    May 17, when the police made<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_122" name=
    "Page_122">[Pg 122]</a></span> arrests, and culminated on May 20, when the
    Government declared Prague under martial law. All political meetings were
    prohibited, and the police issued a proclamation announcing that any
    further disorders would be met with violent measures.</p>

    <p>One of the events that had aroused popular hostility was the suppression
    of the Czech newspaper Narodni Listi. The last copy of this paper contained
    the text of the oath taken at Prague by the Czecho-Slovak, Jugoslav, and
    Polish journalists, as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Gathered at Prague while the world war has made necessary a new
        reorganization of the world on the basis of a higher authority given to
        the people, we proclaim that we shall remain in the front line of
        battle for the freedom of peoples, that we shall fight together in
        favor of each other's interests, that we shall repulse together any
        despotic measure, and that we shall denounce together the oppression of
        the Austrian State.</p>

        <p>We want to promote together the confidence of our people in the
        achievement of their aspirations, to encourage them to express their
        will more positively.</p>

        <p>We raise our right hand and solemnly swear that we shall give all
        that we own, all our strength, all our possessions, for the liberation
        of our people and for the achievement of the political unity of the
        Czecho-Slovak people, the political unity of the Jugoslavs, and the
        political unity of the Polish people.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="RIOTS_IN_WENSEL_SQUARE" name="RIOTS_IN_WENSEL_SQUARE"></a>RIOTS
    IN WENSEL SQUARE</h3>

    <p>The disorders leading to the declaring of martial law were described by
    the Berliner Lokal-Anzeiger a few days later in these terms:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The chief demonstration in the new outbreak occurred in Wensel
        Square in Prague on May 20. The demonstration was a big one and reached
        such pitch that in the evening the police had to interfere. The Czechs
        sang their patriotic hymn with its additional anti-German verses and
        raised cheers for President Wilson and Professor Masaryk, the Bohemian
        delegate now in the United States. Although Wensel Square was
        thereafter barred to the demonstrators by the police, the
        demonstrations were repeated at 10 o'clock at night, and not until
        midnight did the mounted and foot police succeed in restoring
        order.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Another account gave other details:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>At the celebration of the fiftieth anniversary of the Czech National
        Theatre speeches violently attacking Germany were delivered, and the
        renewal of the alliance between Germany and Austria-Hungary was
        denounced. Several deputies addressed the crowd, urging resistance to
        the end and the sacrifice of wealth and blood for Bohemia. The theatre
        was then closed and rioting occurred in the streets outside. The
        Jugoslavs who had participated in the Bohemian festivities were ordered
        to leave the city. Crowds singing patriotic songs accompanied them to
        the railway station.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>In the next week about 800 Czechs were arrested at Prague and other
    Bohemian cities on a charge of seditious conspiracy.</p>

    <h3><a id="REVOLT_IN_AUSTRIAN_ARMY" name=
    "REVOLT_IN_AUSTRIAN_ARMY"></a>REVOLT IN AUSTRIAN ARMY</h3>

    <p>Riots and disorders in Bohemia continued to increase during the
    following weeks. Crowds at Chozen, exasperated by police brutality, set
    fire to barracks and to the City Hall, where the mounted police were
    lodged. Eight of the officers were burned to death. At Kolin the people
    pulled down the Austrian and raised the Bohemian flag. Public buildings
    were burned at Tabor and in other Bohemian towns, also at Olmutz, Moravia.
    At Prague the offices of two German newspapers were sacked. The Neue Freie
    Presse of Vienna declared: "Only the tenacity and union of those who desire
    the preservation of the State can make the monarchy survive this great
    crisis."</p>

    <p>Mutinies among the Slavic troops in the Austrian Army also assumed
    serious proportions. A Vienna dispatch to the Berliner Tageblatt on May 3
    gave the following details:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The troubles began in the Slovene Battalion of the 9th Infantry
        Regiment at Judenbourg. The German officers were killed, after which
        the troops gave themselves up to acts of anarchy. In time they were
        driven into the mountains, where they finally were disarmed after a
        combat.</p>

        <p>The Czechs of Pilsen, stationed at Fumberg, also revolted. The
        rising was put down by the sword. Part of the rebels, having succeeded
        in passing the frontier, took refuge in the mountains of Saxony, where
        they were made prisoner by the Germans.</p>

        <p>A third case of serious revolt took place at Funkirchen, where a
        Serbian regiment from Austria revolted and massacred the officers. The
        exact details of these revolts are difficult to obtain. It
        appears,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_123" name="Page_123">[Pg
        123]</a></span> however, the instigators were Austrian soldiers
        returned from the prisoners' camps in Russia.</p>

    <h3><a id="GERRYMANDERING_BOHEMIA" name=
    "GERRYMANDERING_BOHEMIA"></a>GERRYMANDERING BOHEMIA</h3>

    <p>On May 22 the Austro-Hungarian Government issued a decree dividing
    Bohemia into twelve districts, under a system giving new administrative and
    electoral advantages to the Germanic population. The German minority in the
    Imperial Parliament had been about to be completely isolated by a union of
    the Czechs, Slovaks, Jugoslavs, Ruthenians, and Poles. The electoral
    redistribution sought to avoid this by reducing the Czech strength in the
    Reichsrat at Vienna as well as in the Bohemian Diet. An official French
    bulletin dated May 22 said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The law bulletin of the Austrian Empire publishes a decree according
        to which the district Governments which were so long demanded by the
        Germans are established in Bohemia. The twelve district Captains who
        are nominated will represent the Statthalter of Prague in each district
        and will have the same powers.</p>

        <p>The boundaries of the districts are fixed, so far as possible,
        according to the national grouping. In the words of the decree, "the
        aim is to take the first steps toward the re-establishment of order in
        Bohemia." This decree foreruns undoubtedly a policy of repression, the
        first act of which tends to dismember Bohemia by granting to the German
        elements the guarantees or, better, the privileges which they
        demand.</p>

        <p>Up to the present, Bohemia comprised thirteen districts, only two of
        which had a majority of German population, according to statistics from
        Vienna. In four of the districts there are hardly any Germans. The new
        plan aims at creating in each of the twelve new districts a German
        minority and to grant to this minority, however small it may be,
        considerable advantages in the administrative and electoral
        domains.</p>

        <p>This method is meant to bring about as a first result a considerable
        increase in the number of German deputies in the Diet to the prejudice
        of the Czechs, who until now have held the majority of the seats. It is
        clear that this device of the Pan Germans is bound to arouse the most
        violent opposition on the part of the Czechs.</p>

        <p>A dispatch printed in all the Wagram papers calls attention to the
        fact that martial law has been proclaimed in several districts of
        Bohemia because in certain regions serious riots have occurred. More
        than 150 persons have been put in prison. The estate of Prince
        Furstenberg was ransacked. Riots occurred at Marsch, Ostrau, Pilsen,
        and Nachod. The Czech press expresses itself very violently. The
        Vetcher writes:</p>

        <p>"The Government is trying in vain to present its reform under bright
        colors, but it is evident at first sight, in fact, that nothing but the
        dismembering of Bohemia is under way. The Ministerial decree is
        preparing the parceling out of our fatherland and the foundation of a
        German province made of our own flesh."</p>

        <p>The Narodni Listi, which was suppressed by the censorship as guilty
        of "criminal dealings," has written:</p>

        <p>"It is in vain that threats are hurled at us to divert us from the
        line of conduct which we have decided to follow according to our
        proclamation. It is in vain that the sessions of Parliament are
        adjourned. Our indignation will not be less in June (the Austrian
        Chamber is to resume its sittings on June 19) and our opponents will
        have the opportunity of realizing it. The chart which, according to von
        Seidler, is to be granted to us will not change our resolution: 'We
        shall fight on without any consideration, with compromise, for the
        defense of the Czech State.'</p>

        <p>"This evidently shows the attitude of all the nationalities crushed
        by the Germans and the Magyars in the Dual Monarchy. The movement was
        not entirely unexpected, but it is possible that the fact of
        threatening them with a pitiless repression has advanced it and made it
        more formidable.</p>

        <p>"Emperor Charles is away from Vienna, and on his return he will find
        political conditions which the food situation will make even more
        distressing. Once more the frightfulness of German methods, so dear to
        the Germans, will bear its fruit by arousing rebellion of the people
        oppressed."</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="AUSTRIAN_OFFICIAL_VIEW" name=
    "AUSTRIAN_OFFICIAL_VIEW"></a>AUSTRIAN OFFICIAL VIEW</h3>

    <p>An official Austrian note, referring to the decree, said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Certain events, which were a danger to the safety of the State and
        presented even a character of high treason, took place during the first
        days of the fiftieth anniversary celebration of the founding of the
        National Bohemian Theatre, and led the authorities to take repressive
        measures.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Swiss commentators explain that this alludes to a note from the police
    posted in Prague, which declared that mob gatherings and processions would
    be dispersed by force if necessary. Jugoslav guests, who had come to Prague
    to participate in the celebration, were obliged<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_124" name="Page_124">[Pg 124]</a></span> leave the city, and the
    newspaper Narodni Listi was suspended because the Austrian authorities
    declared: "The manner in which this paper is worded tends to arouse
    sympathy in favor of the Entente States."</p>

    <p>Accounts of the great gathering at Prague, which caused the Austrian
    Government to declare martial law, stated that the city was adorned with
    the Czech colors and the Slav tricolor flag. The Czech press expressed
    regret at the absence of Russians and great satisfaction at the presence of
    Poles. It was reported that the Ruthenians of Eastern Galicia were
    prevented by the authorities from attending.</p>

    <p>The festival was organized by the recently formed Independence Party of
    Dr. Kramarcz, and the ceremonies consisted generally of a glorification of
    the union of the Slavic peoples.</p>

    <h3><a id="WEAKENING_NATIONALISM" name=
    "WEAKENING_NATIONALISM"></a>WEAKENING NATIONALISM</h3>

    <p>It is stated by American sympathizers of the Czechs that the new decree
    is intended also to weaken the Bohemian national movement by decentralizing
    the forces of the nation and partly to prepare for the possible
    establishment of a province of "German Bohemia," such as has been talked of
    in case the national movement is so strong as to force the Austrian
    Government to try to compromise on some sort of federalization.</p>

    <p>The Czecho-Slovak Nation, which has declared its demands for unity and
    complete independence, includes the Slovaks in the northern part of the
    Kingdom of Hungary and the Czechs, now divided among Bohemia, Moravia, and
    Silesia, three of the seventeen crown lands of Austria.</p>

    <p>There has been much reference in German-Austrian papers recently to the
    possible establishment of a German Bohemia, to include the districts with
    the largest German population. Any rearrangement on this basis would be
    beset with obstacles, for the Czecho-Slovaks refuse to consent to any
    partition and the Germans demand not only the border districts for their
    German Bohemia, but the City of Prague itself.</p>

    <p>It was recently reported that in April the Pope, acting through the
    Papal Nuncio at the request of the Vienna Government, had caused the arrest
    of Dr. Yeglitch, Prince Archbishop of Laibach, on account of his activities
    in behalf of the Jugoslav movement. Dr. Yeglitch was the head of the
    Slovene Catholic party in Parliament, and his arrest produced an outburst
    of indignation in Croatia and Slovenia. A Vatican dispatch later declared
    the report of the Pope's connection with the matter to be entirely without
    foundation.</p>

    <h3><a id="BOHEMIANS_IN_ITALYS_ARMY" name=
    "BOHEMIANS_IN_ITALYS_ARMY"></a>BOHEMIANS IN ITALY'S ARMY</h3>

    <p>Troops from Bohemia began joining the Italian Army in April to fight
    against Austria. The first detachments of this Czecho-Slovak army, which is
    being formed in many centres out of the one-time subjects of Emperor Karl,
    have taken up their positions in various parts of the Italian line. They
    wear the Italian uniform, with certain distinctive signs. The effect upon
    their fellow-Slavs who are still fighting under the Austrian colors is a
    subject of considerable interest on both sides. The new position of affairs
    is being assiduously explained to them by airplane propaganda, and
    committees of their own race are accredited to and working with the Italian
    high command. G. Ward Price, a British correspondent, telegraphed from
    Italian headquarters on May 1:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>One night recently some of the Czechs fighting with the Italians
        were in the front line at a place where the Austrian battalion holding
        the trenches opposite consisted largely of their fellow-countrymen.
        After some preliminary conversation by megaphone one of the allied
        Czechs crawled out to the other lines and urged his compatriots to come
        over to our side, where they would be treated not as prisoners or
        deserters but as friends. The Austrian Czechs replied that they would
        willingly do so, but that the line behind their own was held by
        Hungarians, who would almost certainly see them moving out of the
        trench and open fire on them with machine guns.</p>

        <p>The allied Czech brought this message in to his friends, whereupon
        the Italian guns were asked to put down a barrage between the Austrian
        front trenches and their support line, driving the Hungarians to cover
        and isolating them from the Czechs, of whom some were thus able to
        cross over in safety to our side.</p>

    <h3><a id="RACIAL_DIVISIONS_IN_HUNGARY" name=
    "RACIAL_DIVISIONS_IN_HUNGARY"></a>RACIAL DIVISIONS IN HUNGARY</h3>

    <p>Hungary in no less degree than Bohemia presents a problem of racial
    antipathies which has been a cause of serious unrest for centuries;
    aggravated by the present worldwide aspiration for independent nationalism
    it has thrown the country into turmoil and given a strong impetus to a
    revolutionary movement by the non-Magyar inhabitants. In a recent issue of
    The New Europe, D. Draghicescu, in discussing the situation in Hungary,
    gives the following facts regarding its racial divisions:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Hungary is a country of 22,000,000 souls, of whom approximately
        9,000,000 are Magyars and 13,000,000 non-Magyars, belonging to four or
        five different races. The Magyars have always insisted upon the fact
        that in Hungary they form by themselves a block of 9,000,000, while the
        other nationalities, taken altogether, are but 13,000,000, and that
        each of these, taken separately, constitute beside the Magyars a
        negligible minority. Naturally, if the 9,000,000 Magyars lived
        dispersed in all the provinces of Hungary, mingled with other
        nationalities in the proportion of 9 to 13, or 41 per cent., or if in
        each or in the majority of these provinces they formed a majority over
        the non-Magyars, or even an overwhelming majority over the most
        important of these nationalities, nothing could be done; the racial
        question in Hungary should not and would not arise. In that case, no
        doubt, the Hungarian State would properly bear the impress of the most
        numerous race, and would be, in fact, a national Magyar State, and the
        minority races would necessarily be sacrificed, even although their
        blood-brothers across the frontier might form powerful and prosperous
        States, (Rumania, Serbia, &amp;c.) However objectionable might be the
        measures taken by the Magyars against these nationalities, they would,
        in such conditions, be up to a certain point excusable. It is
        impossible to create a strong and workable State and to insure peace
        and prosperity in a country so heterogeneous and containing an
        <i>imbroglio</i> of peoples each facing in its own direction and
        gravitating toward other neighboring States.</p>

    <h3><a id="EACH_RACE_ISOLATED" name="EACH_RACE_ISOLATED"></a>EACH RACE
    ISOLATED</h3>

    <p>He states that the Magyars, however, have never allowed it to be
    understood how the various races have been distributed in the kingdom, and
    he elucidates this as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Hungary consists of several provinces, each of which is inhabited by
        a separate nationality, homogeneous and compact. Of these provinces one
        of the most important beyond question is the Hungarian Pousta, situated
        on the banks of the Theiss and the middle Danube, and inhabited by
        7,000,000 to 8,000,000 Magyars. The remaining 1,000,000 to 2,000,000
        Magyars are scattered over the other provinces, forming the ruling
        caste and providing officials, magistrates, and police. Their business
        is to dominate the nationalities of these provinces and bend them under
        the yoke of the Magyars.</p>

        <p>In these other provinces each race is at home, and is as compact and
        homogeneous as the Magyars in the Pousta. Transylvania, for example,
        with the neighboring plains of the Banat, of Chrishana and Mamaramuresh
        is peopled by 4,000,000 or 5,000,000 Rumanians, among whom there are to
        be found here and there small bodies of Magyars. The Southern Slavs in
        their turn dwell in compact masses of between 5,000,000 and 6,000,000
        in the southern part of Hungary; and there are at least 2,000,000
        Slovaks in the north, who also form a compact group. The Magyars are
        determined that the 7,000,000 to 8,000,000 of the Hungarian Pousta
        shall rule the 13,000,000 of non-Magyars in Transylvania, Jugoslavia,
        and Slovakia, and that these nationalities shall disappear, losing
        their language and individuality and adopting those of the Magyar
        people. It is nothing less than national suicide which the Magyars
        demand from these races, and, since this is refused, the jingoes of
        Budapest, enjoying carte blanche from the Emperor and the European
        powers, have for sixty years been carrying out a veritable campaign of
        murder against the non-Magyar races of Hungary.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="TRANSYLVANIAS_CASE" name="TRANSYLVANIAS_CASE"></a>TRANSYLVANIA'S
    CASE</h3>

    <p>The problem is intensified by the fact that the Serbs and Rumanians of
    Hungary see 5,000,000 of their brother Serbs and 7,500,000 of their brother
    Rumanians across their frontiers in Serbia and in Rumania under separate
    sovereignties of their own people. Mr. Draghicescu continues as
    follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Doubtless, if Transylvania and Jugoslavia were merely isolated
        provinces without affinity or resemblance to neighboring States, as is,
        for example, the case of Ireland in the United Kingdom, we should admit
        that, however great might be the majority of these races over the
        Magyars, the racial question would not and could not arise. It would in
        that case be merely a question of domestic politics and administration
        without international interest. But this is far from being<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_126" name="Page_126">[Pg 126]</a></span> the case
        in Transylvania, for instance, where the Rumanian population touches
        upon three sides the Rumanians of the kingdom, and where it has no
        contact with the Magyars, except on one-third of its racial frontier.
        Moreover, assuming the Magyars to have a certain superficial claim to
        ascendency in Hungary, where they are 41 per cent. of the whole
        population, this claim cannot be admitted in Transylvania, where they
        are but 15 per cent. to 18 per cent. In Jugoslavia the proportion of
        Magyars is even smaller. Now, if we imagine the reunion of Transylvania
        to Rumania to be an accomplished fact, the proportion of races in
        Greater Rumania would be 92 per cent. Rumanians to 8 per cent. Magyars;
        for if to the 7,500,000 Rumanians of the kingdom there are added
        4,500,000 Rumanians of Hungary among whom there live scattered bodies
        of Magyars to the number approximately of 1,000,000, we shall have
        12,000,000 Rumanians to 1,000,000 Magyars.</p>

        <p>In this case, in place of the crying injustice of a 15 per cent.
        Magyar population seeking to dominate and exterminate a Rumanian
        population of 60 per cent., we should have a liberal State in which the
        Rumanians would constitute 93 per cent. and the Magyars between 6 and 7
        per cent. In Jugoslavia the same process would give similar results. It
        is impossible for Serbs and Rumanians to be indifferent to the fate of
        their kinsmen threatened with Magyarization. If they desire to save
        their captive brethren, if they desire to liberate them and unite with
        them, it is not because they are themselves impelled by a spirit of
        conquest and inspired by a reprehensible imperialism. In them such aims
        would be absurd. They are roused against the Magyars by legitimate
        fears for their own fate and liberty in the future. If the Rumanians
        and Serbs of Hungary were finally Magyarized it would be a proof that
        the Serb and Rumanian Nations were ephemeral and might easily disappear
        without harm to any one. Once the resistance of the Serbs and Rumanians
        of Hungary was broken, the fate of the Serbian and Rumanian Kingdoms
        would be sealed. The Magyars, with the help of their German allies and
        masters, would soon overcome the Serbs and Rumanians in the free
        kingdoms, exposed as these would be to the treacherous onslaughts of
        Bulgaria.</p>

        <p>Therefore, the true terms and proportions of this question may be
        stated as follows: It is a war of life or death between 9,000,000
        Magyars and some 25,000,000 Slavs and Latins. The former are vigorously
        upheld by the Germans and the Bulgars. And the others? Surely they
        should have for allies all who desire that Germany and her vassals
        should not destroy the liberties of the world.</p>

    Council Favors Free Poland and Jugoslavia</h2>

    <p>The session of the Supreme War Council of the allied Governments, held
    at Versailles on June 4, 1918, was attended by the Premiers of Great
    Britain, France, and Italy. At the close of its deliberations it issued the
    following statement:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The Supreme War Council held its sixth session under circumstances
        of great gravity for the alliance of free peoples. The German
        Government, relieved of all pressure on the eastern front by the
        collapse of the Russian armies and people, has concentrated all its
        effort in the west. It is now seeking to gain a decision in Europe by a
        series of desperate and costly assaults upon the allied armies before
        the United States can bring its full strength effectively to bear.</p>

        <p>The advantage it possesses in its strategic position and superior
        railway facilities has enabled the enemy command to gain some initial
        successes. It will undoubtedly renew its attacks and the allied nations
        still may be exposed to critical days.</p>

        <p>After a review of the whole position, the Supreme War Council is
        convinced that the Allies, bearing the trials of the forthcoming
        campaign with the same fortitude as they have ever exhibited in defense
        of the right, will baffle the enemy's purpose and in due course bring
        him to defeat. Everything possible is being done to sustain and support
        the armies in the field. The arrangements for unity of command have
        greatly improved the position of the allied armies and are working
        smoothly and with success. The Supreme War Council has complete
        confidence in General Foch. It regards with pride and admiration the
        valor of the allied troops.</p>

        <p>Thanks to the prompt and cordial co-operation of the President of
        the United States, the arrangements which were set on foot more than
        two months ago for the transporting and brigading of American troops
        will make it impossible for the enemy to gain victory by wearing out
        the allied reserve before he has exhausted his own.</p>

        <p>The Supreme War Council is confident of the ultimate result, and the
        allied peoples are resolute not to sacrifice a single<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_127" name="Page_127">[Pg 127]</a></span> one of
        the free nations of the world to the despotism of Berlin. Their armies
        are displaying the same steadfast courage which has enabled them on
        many previous occasions to defeat a German onset. They have only to
        endure with faith and patience to the end to make victory for freedom
        secure. The free peoples and their magnificent soldiers will save
        civilization.</p>

    <p>A supplemental official statement announced that the following
    declarations had been unanimously agreed to by the Premiers of the three
    nations:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The creation of a united, independent Polish State, with free access
        to the sea, constitutes one of the conditions of a solid and just peace
        and the rule of right in Europe.</p>

        <p>The Allies have noted with satisfaction the declaration of the
        American Secretary of State, to which they adhere, expressing the
        greatest sympathy with the national aspirations of the Czechs and
        Jugoslavs for freedom.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="AMERICA_AND_JUGOSLAVS" name="AMERICA_AND_JUGOSLAVS"></a>AMERICA
    AND JUGOSLAVS</h3>

    <p>The American declaration referred to above was made public by Secretary
    Lansing on May 29 in these words:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The Secretary of State desires to announce that the proceedings of
        the Congress of Oppressed Races of Austria-Hungary, which was held in
        Rome in April, have been followed with great interest by the Government
        of the United States, and that the nationalistic aspirations of the
        Czecho-Slovacs and the Jugoslavs for freedom have the earnest sympathy
        of this Government.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Secretary Lansing's declaration was greeted with enthusiasm by Jugoslavs
    in both Europe and America. Premier Pashitch of Serbia a few days later
    communicated to the American Chargé d'Affaires at Corfu his profound
    appreciation of the action of the United States. Another result was a
    formal offer of military service by Jugoslavs residing in this country. The
    offer was made to the Senate Foreign Affairs Committee on June 5 by Don
    Niko Grskovich and John J. Grgurevich, acting as spokesmen for their
    fellow-Slavs. They explained that the Slovenians, Croats, and other South
    Slavs in the United States were intensely hostile to the German-Austrian
    cause, and were eager to cast their lot with the Allies, but because they
    were technically subjects of the Austrian Crown they occupied the status of
    enemy aliens and were unable to join the army.</p>

    <p>"If Congress will enact a law taking this stigma from our people 50,000
    enlistments in the American Army will be the immediate result," Mr.
    Grskovich told the committee. "Ultimately, nearly 500,000 of our people
    will be found fighting under the American flag."</p>

    <h3>Subjection of the Nation to German Tyranny Under a Supplementary
    Economic Treaty</h3>

    <p><span class="smcap">Current History Magazine</span> for June contained
    the text of the main treaty imposed on Rumania by Germany, known as the
    Peace of Bucharest. On May 10 it was announced that a "legal and political
    supplementary agreement" had been exacted, which completed the economic
    subjection of the country. The main clauses of this treaty follow:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="smcap">Clause I.</span>—This provides for the
        resumption of Consular relations and the admission of Consuls. The
        treaty demands that a further Consular treaty shall be concluded as
        soon as possible, and stipulates for the indemnification of all damage
        suffered during the war by Consular officials or done to Consular
        buildings.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause II.</span>—This clause says that Rumania
        renounces indemnifications and damages caused on Rumanian territory as
        the result of German military measures, including all requisitions and
        contributions. Amounts which Germany has already paid for damages of
        the nature just described will be refunded by Rumania in so far as
        these have not been refunded from the country's means, or paid in the
        newly issued notes of the Banca Generale of Rumania, (note issue
        department.)</p>

        <p>Within six months after the ratification of<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_128" name="Page_128">[Pg 128]</a></span> the
        peace treaty Rumania will redeem out of her own means (with notes of
        the Rumanian National Bank or other legal means of payment) the notes
        issued by the Banca Generale, on the order of the occupation
        administration, and will not put them into circulation again, so that
        the balances and deposits which are held by the German Reichsbank for
        the covering of the same may become free.</p>

        <p>Until redemption, the notes of the Banca Generate shall be
        recognized as legal tender. After the ratification of the peace treaty
        such notes shall no longer be issued.</p>

        <p>Another article, under the same clause, provides that Rumania shall
        indemnify the Germans for all damages suffered by them on Rumanian
        territory as the result of the military measures of one of the
        belligerent powers. This stipulation also applies to the losses which
        the Germans have suffered as participants, and especially as
        shareholders, of undertakings situated in Rumanian territory.
        Immediately after the ratification of the treaty a commission shall
        meet in Bucharest to fix the amount of such losses. The contracting
        parties will each appoint a third of the members, and the President of
        the Swiss Federal Council will be asked to designate neutral personages
        to make up the other third, which is to include the Chairman.</p>

        <p>Rumania will also indemnify neutral nations for damage which has
        been caused them on Rumanian territory as a result of German military
        measures, and which must be made good according to the principles of
        international law.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause III.</span>—This clause stipulates for
        the restoration of treaties and agreements between the contracting
        parties which were in force before the war, except for those cases in
        which the peace treaty provides otherwise, and in cases where such
        instruments are undenouncable for a certain period. This period is
        prolonged by the period of the duration of the war.</p>

        <p>The contracting parties reserve until after the conclusion of a
        general peace the fixing of their attitude toward separate and
        collective treaties of a political character.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause IV.</span>—This contains prescriptions
        governing the restoration of ordinary relations between debtor and
        creditor. It says, too, that each contracting party will, immediately
        after the ratification of the treaty, resume the payment of its
        obligations, particularly the public debt service, to subjects of the
        other party.</p>

        <p>Restoration and compensation for concessions and privileges in land
        and other rights are also dealt with.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause V.</span>—This deals with compensation
        for damage suffered during or immediately before the outbreak of war by
        civilian subjects of the respective parties in life, health, liberties,
        or property through acts contrary to international law.</p>

        <p>Germans who were in the Rumanian public service before the war, and
        who were dismissed as enemy foreigners, shall, on their request, be
        restored to equal rank and equal salary, or, if this is impracticable,
        they shall be given fair compensation.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause VI.</span>—This clause says that the
        respective prisoners of war shall be sent home in so far as they, with
        the assent of the State concerned, do not desire to remain in its
        territory or to proceed to another country. The exchange of prisoners
        is to follow as soon as possible, at definite times to be further
        agreed upon.</p>

        <p>The expenditure of each party for prisoners of war belonging to the
        other party up to April 1, 1918, will be calculated on the basis of an
        average rate of 2,000 marks (£100) for each officer in Germany, and
        1,000 for all other prisoners in Germany, and 2,500 (£100) and 1,250
        lei respectively for prisoners in Rumania. Immediately on the
        ratification of the treaty a commission composed of three members of
        each party is to meet in Bucharest to arrange details and to supervise
        the carrying out of the agreement.</p>

        <p>Interned civilians will also be gratuitously sent home as soon as
        possible, in so far as they do not wish to remain in the country of
        their internment or go elsewhere.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause VII.</span>—This relates to the right of
        subjects of the contracting parties to return to the country of their
        origin without suffering prejudice.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause VIII.</span>—This stipulates an amnesty
        for offenses committed by prisoners of war, interned men, and certain
        others. It incidentally stipulates that Rumania shall grant an amnesty
        to its subjects for their political conduct or military conduct based
        upon political grounds during the war.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause IX.</span>—This provides that captured
        river craft, merchant ships, and cargoes shall be returned, or, if no
        longer in existence, be paid for, and compensation shall also be paid
        for the period they were in the captor's possession. Here, too, a
        commission will be appointed.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause X.</span>—This stipulates that various
        rights shall be accorded to German churches and schools in Rumania.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause XI.</span>—This says: "Rumania, after
        having obtained the assent of the Rumanian National Bank, agrees that
        the balances and deposits of the National Bank now at the German
        Reichsbank shall remain in the Reichsbank's charge for five years (and
        if Rumania falls behind with an installment, for ten years) as a
        security for Rumania's Public Debt Service, as regards the subjects of
        Germany; and may also, if necessary, be drawn on to pay interest and
        redeem drawn bonds."</p>

        <p>The representatives of the contracting parties will meet in Berlin
        within four weeks after the signature of the treaty to make further
        arrangements regarding the fulfillment and further guaranteeing of
        Rumania's financial obligations.</p>

        <p><span class="smcap">Clause XII.</span>—This provides that the
        respective representatives shall meet in Berlin<span class=

    <h3><a id="CONTROL_OF_OIL_FIELDS" name="CONTROL_OF_OIL_FIELDS"></a>CONTROL
    OF OIL FIELDS</h3>

    <p>Under the petroleum agreement between the Central Powers and Rumania,
    the Central Powers' controlling company, the Oil Lands Leasing Company, is
    endowed with exclusive rights of the most far-reaching character for thirty
    years, with the right of prolongation for two subsequent periods of thirty
    years, making ninety in all.</p>

    <p>Up to one-quarter of the foundation shares will be offered to the
    Rumanian Government with the right of transfer to private interests, but
    Germany and Austria-Hungary insure their control by the creation of
    preference shares with a fifty-fold voting right, and these shares are
    exclusively at their disposal.</p>

    <p>A State trading monopoly in oil in Rumania is also provided for, the
    exercise of the monopoly to be intrusted to a company that is to be formed
    by a financial group designated by the German and Austro-Hungarian
    Governments.</p>

    <p>All kinds of privileges are stipulated for the Oil Lands Leasing
    Company, the position of which is most carefully hedged around.</p>

    <p>The parties are agreed by the terms of Article IV. of the foregoing
    agreement that immediately after the ratification of the peace treaty the
    Rumanian Government will enter into negotiations with the Governments of
    Germany and Austria-Hungary regarding the manner in which Rumania's surplus
    oil and oil products can be placed at the disposal of Germany and
    Austria-Hungary without endangering the vital interests of Rumania in
    respect of the country's industries and its own needs. The provisions of
    Article IV.,therefore, only enter into force should no other understanding
    have been arrived at before Dec. 1, 1918.</p>

    <h3><a id="COST_OF_RUMANIAS_PEACE" name="COST_OF_RUMANIAS_PEACE"></a>COST
    OF RUMANIA'S PEACE</h3>

    <p>A correspondent who was at Jassy for years and left there only a few
    days before the peace treaty was signed thus writes of Rumania's hard
    fate:</p>

    <p>"What is the balance sheet of Rumania after eighteen months' hard
    struggle? Before August, 1916, she had absolute economic freedom and could
    sell her harvests to any one she pleased at any price she wanted. In 1915
    and 1916 the Rumanian exporters sold wheat to Germany and Austria at from
    10s. to 12s. a bushel. The Austro-German importers had to pay, besides, a
    heavy export tax in gold to the Rumanian Government. Now Germany has
    secured for herself and her allies practically the whole Rumanian harvest
    for years to come, at a price which she is going to fix, and in such
    conditions that 'no diplomatic intervention should be necessary in the
    future for securing the grain necessary for the allied Central Powers.'</p>

    <p>"Rumania had in Europe, after Russia, the richest oil fields and the
    greatest production of oil. The fields were in American, German, and
    English hands, but the Rumanian Government had full control of the
    production and drew very large benefits. When the war broke out in 1914 the
    Rumanian Government at once prohibited the export of petrol and heavy oils
    to Germany. The German companies tried hard to send the much-needed petrol
    to their countries, but succeeded in smuggling only a small quantity
    through at enormous cost. After a year the production of petrol increased
    so much that the Government was compelled to allow the export of a small
    quantity, asking Germany in exchange to agree that Rumania should receive a
    certain quantity of goods the export of which was prohibited in Germany.
    The Germans will not forget that they had to pay for the petrol at the rate
    of about $200 a ton."</p>

    <h3><a id="GERMAN_OIL_MONOPOLY" name="GERMAN_OIL_MONOPOLY"></a>GERMAN OIL
    MONOPOLY</h3>

    <p>"Since November, 1916, the Rumanian oil industry has been destroyed. In
    the last ten days before the Germans penetrated into the rich Prahova
    Valley the British mission under Lieut. Col. Norton Griffiths destroyed
    everything—wells, tanks, refineries were burned, smashed to pieces, or
    blown up, so that even now, after a year and a half, the Germans have not
    been able to reconstruct them. According to statements made by German
    prisoners in November last, none of <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_130"
    name="Page_130">[Pg 130]</a></span>obstructed wells had been put in order
    again. The German engineers have worked hard, boring new wells, but have
    not succeeded in getting more than 10 to 15 per cent. of the normal
    production. However, although the refineries and wells have been destroyed,
    the oil fields exist, and I think that not even 50 per cent. of them have
    yet been worked in Rumania. The Germans know this, and the clause in the
    peace treaty that they should have the control and monopoly of the oil
    fields for ninety-nine years will make them the real owners and entirely
    independent of the American market. These two assets—the corn and the
    oil—on which the whole wealth of the Rumanian Kingdom was based, are thus
    under direct German control."</p>

    <p>"Furthermore, Rumania has suffered much during the war. Towns and
    villages have been destroyed, and nearly the entire stock of railway
    carriages, vans, and locomotives has been lost. The productive capacity of
    the country has been enormously diminished. About 60 per cent. of the
    horned cattle and more than 70 per cent. of the horses have gone. Famine
    and disease have made ravages among the rural population, nobody having
    paid any attention to them. I have seen villages of 300 to 500 inhabitants
    reduced to 40. All the rest died from spotted typhus or other scourges.
    This shows how reduced are the means of national recovery after peace is
    signed. The financial situation is probably worse than the economic. At the
    outbreak of the war the budget amounted to 500,000,000 lei, ($100,000,000,)
    while the national debt was about 1,500,000,000 lei, ($300,000,000.) A few
    weeks before I left Jassy the Minister of Finance told me that the debt had
    increased to about $1,250,000,000. In the period from August, 1916, to
    February, 1918, the revenue had been very greatly reduced. As the military
    situation was always critical and the Government had decided twice, before
    the Russian disaster, to move to Russia, everybody who had a little money
    kept it at home and did not invest it in Government securities. Therefore
    only a small amount had been raised in Rumania by loans; the greatest part
    of the money had to be obtained from abroad, mainly from England, but also
    from France and the United States, at a rate of 4 to 5 per cent. Thus the
    interest which Rumania had to pay on her national debt represented about
    $62,500,000, or more than three-quarters of her budget in the pre-war
    days."</p>

    <h3><a id="VON_KUEHLMANNS_EXPLANATION" name=
    "VON_KUEHLMANNS_EXPLANATION"></a>VON KUEHLMANN'S EXPLANATION</h3>

    <p>Dr. von Kühlmann, the German Foreign Secretary, who forced the treaty,
    in an address before the Berlin Chamber of Commerce May 24, explained the
    advantages which the peace of Bucharest had brought to Germany. He
    said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Two points must be taken into consideration: First, guaranteeing
        Rumanian agricultural and petroleum production as urgently necessary
        for the carrying on of the war by the Central Powers and for the
        transition period; and, secondly, the important rôle which Rumania has
        to fill in providing a thoroughfare to the East, especially as she
        dominates the lower course of the Danube.</p>

        <p>It is here that there comes into effect the International Danube
        Delta Committee, upon which only States on the banks of the Danube can
        be represented. Only if the States agree to it will the countries lying
        on the Black Sea be able to come into it. Therefore, it is especially
        important for the German seaboard traffic that we have been able to
        secure sites for dockyards.</p>

        <p>Along with the Danube, the importance of the Rumanian railways must
        be considered, especially the Bucharest-Czernavoda-Constanza line, over
        which Germany must have control. It has been agreed with Bulgaria that
        this railway to Constanza, which is to be made a free port with grain
        silos and petroleum tanks, is to be leased to a German company for
        ninety-nine years.</p>

        <p>The cable between Constantinople and Constanza played an important
        rôle before the war. This cable is to be developed to the utmost and
        secured from enemy control.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Alluding to the agreement by which Germany had secured the Rumanian
    harvest of 1918-19, and the far-reaching option upon the entire Rumanian
    harvest for the next seven years, Dr. von Kühlmann said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>One can look forward to the whole food question with a certain
        amount of confidence. * * * Formal war indemnities were not demanded by
        Germany, but the numerous privileges we secured<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_131" name="Page_131">[Pg 131]</a></span> are
        equivalent, in the opinion of experts, to anything which would have
        been yielded by indemnities. When, some day, the damage caused by the
        U-boat warfare shall have been made good by newly-built ships, the sea
        route from Constanza will regain its importance. Whether traffic on the
        Danube will be able to compete with it is a question of the distant
        future. For the present we shall have to rely on the Danube.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="MODEL_PEACE_TERMS" name="MODEL_PEACE_TERMS"></a>MODEL PEACE
    TERMS</h3>

    <p>Discussing this treaty on June 1, the Nachrichten of Munich
    declared:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The peace concluded with Rumania should serve as a model for the
        general peace terms to be concluded by the Central Powers. Germany has
        found a method of making conquered countries share her enormous war
        burdens without actually inflicting a crushing war indemnity. This
        method consists in enforcing on them a stipulation for preferential
        treatment to be accorded to Germany over a long period, so that Germany
        may be fully supplied with goods she needs. In this way Rumania will
        furnish the Central Powers with wheat and petroleum on advantageous
        terms for ninety years. A similar happy solution must also be adopted
        in all peace treaties to be conducted in the future.</p>

    PHASE</h2>

    <h3>Turkish Invasion of the Caucasus Under the Brest Treaty—Struggle of the
    Georgians</h3>

    <p>By the terms of the Brest-Litovsk treaty the Bolshevist Government of
    Russia gave up to Turkey the districts of Batum, Kars, and Erivan,
    comprising the southwestern portion of the Caucasus, between the Black and
    Caspian Seas. This region includes the Russian part of the former Kingdom
    of Armenia, with Turkish Armenia adjoining it on the south. It is inhabited
    largely by Armenians and by that other ancient people, the Georgians,
    between whom and the Turks there has been an age-long and deadly feud.
    Hundreds of thousands of Armenian refugees from Turkish persecution in Asia
    Minor had taken refuge here under the Russian flag in the last three years,
    especially after the first Petrograd revolution gave promise of liberty
    under a republic. Now Georgians and Armenians alike find themselves
    betrayed into the hands of their Turkish enemies.</p>

    <p>Soon after the signing of the treaty on March 3, 1918,<a id=
    "the_Turks_sent_armed_forces" name="the_Turks_sent_armed_forces"></a> the
    Turks sent armed forces to take possession of the three districts named.
    They met with resistance both from the Armenians and from the Georgians,
    but neither of the betrayed nationalities had an army competent to cope
    with the enemy. The result was a new reign of terror, similar to that of
    the atrocities that ensued.</p>

    <h3><a id="PROTEST_OF_ARMENIANS" name="PROTEST_OF_ARMENIANS"></a>PROTEST OF
    ARMENIANS</h3>

    <p>The Armenian National Council on April 14 addressed the following
    protest to the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs and to the President of
    the Reichstag:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The Armenian National Council, as the supreme body for the
        expression of the will of the Armenian people, is addressing you in
        connection with the tragic state of things in Armenia. Armenia is
        flooded with blood and, only recently saved from centuries of slavery,
        is again condemned to fresh sufferings. Following upon the withdrawal
        of the Russian troops, Turkish troops have already invaded the
        undefended country and are not only killing every Turkish Armenian but
        also every Russian in Armenia.</p>

        <p>In spite of the terms of the peace treaty, which recognizes the
        right of self-determination for these Caucasian regions, the Turkish
        Army is advancing toward Kars and Ardahan, destroying the country and
        killing the Christian population. The responsibility for the future
        destiny of the Armenians lies entirely with Germany, because it was
        Germany's insistence that resulted in the withdrawal of the Russian
        troops from the Armenian regions, and at the moment it rests with
        Germany to prevent the habitual excesses of the Turkish troops,
        increased by revengefulness and anger.</p>

        <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_132" name="Page_132">[Pg
        132]</a></span></p>

        <p>It is hard to believe that a civilized State like Germany, which has
        the means for preventing the excesses of her ally, will permit the
        Brest-Litovsk treaty to be used by the German people, who have been
        involved in war against their own will, as a means for the creation of
        incalculable sufferings.</p>

        <p>The National Council firmly believes that you will undertake the
        necessary measures, which depend solely upon you, to influence the
        Turkish authorities with a view to saving the Armenian people from
        fresh horrors.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="POLICY_OF_ANNIHILATION" name="POLICY_OF_ANNIHILATION"></a>POLICY
    OF ANNIHILATION</h3>

    <p>To this protest the Bolshevist Government of Russia added the
    following:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The offensive of the Turkish troops and detachments on the Caucasian
        front has been followed by the murder of the whole Armenian population.
        The peaceful population of women and children have been killed without
        mercy and their property has been plundered and burned.</p>

        <p>The peace treaty, which we were forced to sign at Brest-Litovsk,
        left the determination of the future destiny of the people of the
        provinces of Ardahan, Kars, and Batum to themselves. The events which
        have taken place in these provinces testify that the old policy of the
        annihilation of the Armenian people is still to be applied.</p>

        <p>On the Turkish front the advantage of the war was on the side of
        Russia, and Russia was forced to give up Ardahan, Kars, and Batum only
        because Germany was the ally of Turkey. The responsibility for all the
        horrors which the Armenian population is now suffering in those regions
        already occupied by the Turkish troops lies, therefore, with the German
        Government, which directly helped Turkey to secure these regions.</p>

        <p>The People's Commissariat for Foreign Affairs protests against such
        abuse of the right of self-determination of the population of these
        provinces, and expresses the hope and insists on the necessity of
        immediate and energetic intervention on the part of Germany in the
        Caucasus, with a view to stopping further murders and the annihilation
        of the peaceful population, such as has taken place in Ardahan.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Armenians and Georgians fought the advancing Turks, but their
    efforts were in vain; on April 17 Batum fell to the Turks, and the Ottoman
    troops were said to have a firm grip on these and other portions of the
    Caucasus.</p>

    <h3><a id="STORY_OF_THE_GEORGIANS" name="STORY_OF_THE_GEORGIANS"></a>STORY
    OF THE GEORGIANS</h3>

    <p>The rugged mountain region between the Black and Caspian Seas, known as
    the Caucasus, covers 180,603 square miles consists of 14 provinces. The
    population in 1914 was 11,735,100, of whom 87 per cent. were illiterate;
    there are no less than 46 distinct nationalities among the inhabitants,
    chief of which are the Georgians and Armenians. The Georgians were the only
    nationality to maintain their independence up to the end of the eighteenth
    century. Georgia existed as a State long before the Christian era;
    Alexander the Great conquered the country. In 1080 the Kingdom of Georgia
    was established by David III. Peter the Great of Russia, recognizing its
    importance, entered into an alliance with the kingdom, and in 1721 Russian
    and Georgian troops penetrated to Baku, the rich industrial district
    bordering on the Caspian Sea. King Heraklius II., who reigned during the
    middle and end of the eighteenth century, received high praise from
    Catherine the Great and Frederick the Great for his military prowess and
    intellect, and in 1768 Russia and Georgia took joint action against the
    Turks.</p>

    <p>In 1783 the Turks and Persians invaded Georgia, and Russia again
    concluded a treaty of protection, in which Georgia's independence was
    guaranteed. In 1801 Russia violated this treaty by annexing Georgia as a
    Russian province. The people revolted, but the uprising was unsuccessful.
    The Georgian mountaineers, however, never became reconciled to Russian
    dominion, and in connection with the Circassians carried on guerrilla
    warfare for forty years. In 1864 they were finally defeated and given the
    choice of submitting or emigrating to Turkey. Only 90,000 submitted and
    418,000 emigrated to Turkey.</p>

    <p>The jubilee of 100 years' alliance between the Kingdom of Georgia and
    Russia was celebrated in Tiflis, Sept. 26, 1901. At that time Czar Nicholas
    II. issued a manifesto acknowledging the loyalty of the Georgian people,
    who "voluntarily placed the kingdom under our protection," expressing
    imperial thanks to the Georgian Nation, and extending the promise of "my
    special attention and care for this brave nation, which is united with us
    by common ties of religion." This in face of the further fact that in 1811
    the independence of the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_133" name=
    "Page_133">[Pg 133]</a></span> Georgian Church, which had existed since the
    year 542, was abolished by the Russians and only six Bishoprics out of
    twenty-eight were allowed to remain, while more than $350,000,000 of church
    property was confiscated!</p>

    <h3><a id="PROGRESS_AMONG_GEORGIANS" name=
    "PROGRESS_AMONG_GEORGIANS"></a>PROGRESS AMONG GEORGIANS</h3>

    <p>D. Ghambashidze, in a recent statement regarding the Georgian Nation,
    alludes to the progress made in the second half of the nineteenth century
    as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The number of daily papers and weeklies in 1913 was twenty-four, and
        the number of books published in the same year on various subjects was
        about 240, amounting to 460,000 copies. It must also be remembered that
        75 per cent. of the total population can read and write, and there are
        many schools and libraries. Eighty-five per cent. of the total
        population is composed of peasantry, whose chief occupation is very
        intensive agriculture, tobacco, wine, cotton, and silk being included
        in their products. The co-operative movement is also very strong in
        Georgia, there being about 400 co-operative societies, nearly 70 per
        cent. of the peasants being members.</p>

        <p>During the last eight centuries the nobility of Georgia has devoted
        its attention chiefly to military occupations. There were about 5,700
        officers in the Russian Army, among whom may be mentioned the very
        distinguished Generals, Princes Bagration, Amilakhvari, Tchavachavadze,
        Orbelliani, and Amiradjebi. Prince Imeretinski has acted as Governor
        General of Poland, and through his wise rule won great respect among
        the Poles. He was instrumental in obtaining the permission of the
        Emperor for the erection of a monument to the great Polish poet
        Mickevits in Warsaw. General Kazbek was commander of the fortress of
        Vladivostok and General Orbelliani was Commander in Chief of the
        Russian troops stationed in Finland.</p>

        <p>Among the Georgian Bishops the most celebrated was Bishop Gabriel,
        whose famous sermons have been translated into English by the Rev. Dr.
        Malan, one-time Vicar of Oxford. There were also a great many Georgian
        professors at various Russian universities, among them the celebrated
        physiologist, Professor Tarhanov; the philologist, Professor D.
        Tchubinov, and Petriev, the late Dean of Odessa University.
        Distinguished Georgians like Prince Tchavachavadze and Eristov were
        members of the Russian House of Lords, while Mr. Tsereteli, the
        celebrated Georgian Deputy in the Duma, acted as one of the leaders
        during the present revolution.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>The Armenian Nation also goes far <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_134"
    name="Page_134">[Pg 134]</a></span>back into ancient history. Six centuries
    before Christ the texts engraved on the rocks by King Darius mentioned
    Armenia by its present name. During centuries immediately before and after
    the beginning of the Christian era Armenia was an independent kingdom
    occupying the region between Mesopotamia and the valleys south of the
    Caucasus Mountains. This kingdom became Christian about the same time as
    the Roman Empire, and since then the Armenian Church has not ceased to be
    independent, not only of the Eastern, Greek, and Slavic Churches, but also
    of the Roman Church.</p>

    <p>Professor Meillet of the Collège de France, Paris, states that there has
    been an Armenian literature since the fifth century of our era, and that
    the old Armenian writings are more original and interesting than the
    ancient Slavic literatures, which date from several centuries later.
    Historians of art agree that in architecture, from the fifth to the ninth
    century, the Armenians were creators of new forms. Professor Meillet adds
    that at a time when the very name of Franco did not yet exist, and when the
    French language had not been differentiated literature of its own.</p>

    <p>At the period of the Crusades the Armenians founded a kingdom in Cilicia
    and aided the Crusaders. Since the last of the Crusades there have been no
    independent Armenians. Mussulman, Persian, and Turkish States have
    dominated their former country. In the nineteenth century the Caucasus
    portion was taken by Russia. But the Armenian Nation had its own customs,
    language, literature, and church, and all these it has kept. It had the
    will to live, and in spite of its subjugation it has lived.</p>

    <h3><a id="SUCCESSFUL_EMIGRANTS" name="SUCCESSFUL_EMIGRANTS"></a>SUCCESSFUL
    EMIGRANTS</h3>

    <p>Armenians, hindered by persecution from tilling their lands, emigrated
    to other countries, where they developed eminent qualities. Industrious
    farmers, attached to their native land, they have yet known how, under
    necessity, to adapt themselves to all the professions of the modern world.
    Thus they came to fill a large place in Constantinople, in Egypt, in
    Transylvania, in Poland, and more recently in Baku, in the whole basin
    of<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_135" name="Page_135">[Pg
    135]</a></span> the Mediterranean, and even in America. Everywhere they
    have made useful citizens; it was an Armenian, Althen, who introduced the
    cultivation of madder in Southern France. In their own country, where they
    had preserved a patriarchal system, most of them remained farmers.</p>

    <p>The Armenian Church, which has not ceased to be autonomous, is the most
    democratic of the ancient Christian Churches; it is the only one in which
    laymen take part with the priests in the election of the head of the
    Church, the Catholicos, who lives in the Convent of Etchmiadzin, in Russian
    Armenia.</p>

    <p>In the nineteenth century, though possessing no intellectual centre of
    their own, the Armenians found means for giving a modern literature to
    Russian Armenia and another to Turkish Armenia. Occupying a part of Asia
    that is a natural passageway between the Orient and the Occident, says
    Professor Meillet, they have been, since the fifth century, carriers of
    European civilization. Their vanguard position has made of them the martyrs
    of Western culture. Their success and their European character made them
    odious to their Turkish masters, who were less industrious than they. By
    the Treaty of Berlin in 1878 Turkey pledged herself to introduce reforms
    and ameliorations in Armenia, and to protect these people from attacks by
    the Kurds and Circassians; but the pledge was never kept. After the
    massacres at Sassun in 1894 Europe made a more imperious demand for
    reforms; Sultan Abdul Hamid promised them—and immediately ordered the great
    massacres of 1895 and 1896, which won for him the name of the Red
    Sultan.</p>

    <h3><a id="UNDER_THE_YOUNG_TURKS" name="UNDER_THE_YOUNG_TURKS"></a>UNDER
    THE YOUNG TURKS</h3>

    <p>The Young Turk revolution promised to improve the lot of the Armenians
    by instituting liberty in the Ottoman Empire; in reality the Young Turks
    desired only to make a unified empire of which they should be masters; they
    tried to "Turkify" all the races under them by persecuting those who wished
    to keep their own character; in 1909 they caused the Armenians at Adana to
    be massacred.</p>

    <p>When the Young Turk Government allied itself with the Central Empires,
    learning organization from the Germans, it organized the destruction of the
    Armenians in 1915 on scientific lines. It ordered the deportation of these
    people from land which they had occupied for more than 2,000 years, and,
    after massacring the men and seizing the young women, it caused the rest of
    the women and the children to perish of hunger, thirst, and fatigue along
    the highways into which they had been driven; it sent them to die in the
    deserts of Syria and Mesopotamia. Hundreds of thousands of Armenians were
    thus destroyed. When the victorious Russian troops entered Erzerum and
    Trebizond they found only a few dozens of Armenians out of the tens of
    thousands who had inhabited those cities. The German authorities knew of
    these massacres; they made no protest.</p>

    <p>In Syria the Christian population was destroyed by other methods; all
    the food was taken away, and then the district was isolated and the
    entrance of new food supplies forbidden. Hundreds of thousands of Syrians
    died of hunger. Germany knew of this crime; it did not protest.</p>

    <h3><a id="EXTERMINATING_A_RACE" name=
    "EXTERMINATING_A_RACE"></a>EXTERMINATING A RACE</h3>

    <p>The great war gave the Young Turk leaders their long-desired opportunity
    to crush the Armenians. Henry Morgenthau, the United States Ambassador at
    Constantinople at that time, says in a recent statement:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>During the Spring of 1915 they evolved their plan to destroy the
        Armenian race. They criticised their ancestors for neglecting to
        destroy or convert the Christian races to Mohammedanism at the time
        when they first subjugated them. Now, as four of the great powers were
        at war with them and the two others were their allies, they thought the
        time opportune to make good the oversight of their ancestors in the
        fifteenth century. They drafted the able-bodied Armenians into the army
        without, however, giving them arms; they used them simply to build
        roads or do similar work. Then, under the pretext of searching the
        houses for arms, they pillaged the belongings of the villagers. * * *
        The final and worst measure was the wholesale deportation of the entire
        population from their homes<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_136" name=
        "Page_136">[Pg 136]</a></span> and their exile to the desert, with all
        the accompanying horrors on the way. * * * The facts contained in the
        reports received at the embassy from absolutely trustworthy
        eyewitnesses surpass the most beastly and diabolical cruelties ever
        perpetrated or imagined in the history of the world.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="BARBAROUS_TORTURES" name="BARBAROUS_TORTURES"></a>BARBAROUS
    TORTURES</h3>

    <p>Many of these horrors were told in detail in the monumental report of
    Viscount Bryce, portions of which were published in <span class=
    "smcap">Current History Magazine</span>, November, 1916. To these may be
    added a statement made to Mr. Morgenthau personally by an eyewitness—a
    German missionary!—and put into writing at the American Embassy in
    Constantinople, which reads in part as follows:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It was that very afternoon that I received the first terrible
        reports, but I did not fully believe them. A few millers and bakers,
        whose services were needed by the Government, had remained, and they
        received the news first. The men had all been tied together and shot
        outside of the town. The women and children were taken to the
        neighboring villages, placed in houses by the hundreds, and either
        burned alive or thrown into the river. (Our buildings being in the main
        quarter of the town we could receive the news quite promptly.)
        Furthermore, one could see women and children pass by with blood
        streaming down, weeping. * * * Who can describe such pictures? Add to
        all this the sight of burning houses and the smell of many burning
        corpses.</p>

        <p>Within a week everything was nearly over. The officers boasted now
        of their bravery, that they had succeeded in exterminating the whole
        Armenian race. Three weeks later when we left Moush, the villages were
        still burning. Nothing that belonged to the Armenians, either in the
        city or the villages, was allowed to remain. In Moush alone there were
        25,000 Armenians; besides, Moush had 300 villages with a large Armenian
        population.</p>

        <p>We left for Mezreh. The soldiers who accompanied us showed us with
        pride where and how and how many women and children they had
        killed.</p>

        <p>We were very pleased to see upon our arrival at Harpoot that the
        orphanages were full. This was, however, all that could be said.
        Mamuret-ul-Aziz has become the cemetery of all the Armenians; all the
        Armenians from the various vilayets were sent there, and those who had
        not died on the way came there simply to find their graves.</p>

        <p>Another terrible thing in Mamuret-ul-Aziz were the tortures to which
        the people had been subjected for two months, and they had generally
        treated so harshly the families of the better class. Feet, hands,
        chests were nailed to a piece of wood; nails of fingers and toes were
        torn out; beards and eyebrows pulled out; feet were hammered with
        nails, as they do with horses; others were hung with their feet up and
        heads down over closets. * * * Oh! How one could wish that all these
        facts were not true! In order that people outside might not hear the
        screams of agony of the poor victims, men stood around the prison
        wherein these atrocities were committed, with drums and whistles.</p>

        <p>On July 1 the first 2,000 were dispatched from Harpoot. They were
        soldiers, and it was rumored that they would build roads. People became
        frightened. Whereupon the Vali called the German missionary, Mr. ——,
        and begged him to quiet the people; he was so very sorry that they all
        had such fears, &amp;c. They had hardly been away for a day when they
        were all killed in a mountain pass. They were bound together, and when
        the Kurds and soldiers started to shoot at them some managed to escape
        in the dark. The next day another 2,000 were sent in the direction of
        Diarbekr. Among those deported were several of our orphans (boys) who
        had been working for the Government all the year round. Even the wives
        of the Kurds came with their knives and murdered the Armenians. Some of
        the latter succeeded in fleeing. When the Government heard that some
        Armenians had managed to escape they left those who were to be deported
        without food for two days in order that they would be too weak to be
        able to flee.</p>

        <p>All the high Catholic Armenians, together with their Archbishop,
        were murdered. Up to now there still remained a number of tradesmen
        whom the Government needed and therefore had not deported; now these,
        too, were ordered to leave, and were murdered.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="TOTAL_NUMBER_MURDERED" name="TOTAL_NUMBER_MURDERED"></a>TOTAL
    NUMBER MURDERED</h3>

    <p>The total Armenian population in the Turkish Empire in 1912 numbered
    between 1,600,000 and 2,000,000. Of these 182,000 escaped to the Russian
    Caucasus, where now again they have been placed in peril of extermination
    at the hands of the Turks. About 4,200 escaped into Egypt, while 150,000
    still remain in Constantinople. To these figures must be added the
    relatively small number of survivors still in hiding or scattered in
    distant provinces. Mr. Morgenthau concludes that 1,000,000 Armenians were
    harried out of their homes in Asia Minor,<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_137" name="Page_137">[Pg 137]</a></span> that the murdered number
    between 600,000 and 800,000. The remainder, in pitiful want of the barest
    necessities of life, hold out their hands to the Christian fellowship of
    America for aid.</p>

    <p>In how far was the German Government responsible for the murder and
    deportation of the Armenians in Turkey? Mr. Morgenthau, summing up the
    story of his own fruitless efforts to get Baron Wangenheim, the German
    Ambassador, to intervene in their behalf, says: "Let me say most
    emphatically, the German Government could have prevented it." Now again it
    is the German Government that has handed over the Armenian refugees in the
    Russian Caucasus to the tender mercy of the Turks.</p>

    <h3>Important Utterances on War Themes</h3>

    <p class="center" style="font-style: italic">President Wilson delivered two
    public addresses in May, 1918, the first in New York City, May 17, to
    inaugurate the second Red Cross campaign, the second before a joint session
    of the United States Congress, May 27, on the subject of a Federal revenue
    bill. The speeches are given herewith.</p>

    <h3><a id="Red_Cross_Speech_in_New_York" name=
    "Red_Cross_Speech_in_New_York"></a>Red Cross Speech in New York</h3>

    <p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Delivered in the Metropolitan Opera
    House, New York City, May 17, 1918</span>]</p>

    <p>There are two duties with which we are face to face. The first duty is
    to win the war. And the second duty that goes hand in hand with it is to
    win it greatly and worthily, showing the real quality of our power not
    only, but the real quality of our purpose and of ourselves. Of course, the
    first duty, the duty that we must keep in the foreground of our thought
    until it is accomplished, is to win the war. I have heard gentlemen
    recently say that we must get 5,000,000 men ready. Why limit it to
    5,000,000?</p>

    <p>I have asked the Congress of the United States to name no limit, because
    the Congress intends, I am sure, as we all intend, that every ship that can
    carry men or supplies shall go laden upon every voyage with every man and
    every supply she can carry. And we are not to be diverted from the grim
    purpose of winning the war by any insincere approaches upon the subject of
    peace. I can say with a clear conscience that I have tested those
    intimations and have found them insincere. I now recognize them for what
    they are, an opportunity to have a free hand, particularly in the East, to
    carry out purposes of conquest and exploitation.</p>

    <p>Every proposal with regard to accommodation in the West involves a
    reservation with regard to the East. Now, so far as I am concerned, I
    intend to stand by Russia as well as France. The helpless and the
    friendless are the very ones that need friends and succor, and if any men
    in Germany think we are going to sacrifice anybody for our own sake, I tell
    them now they are mistaken. For the glory of this war, my fellow-citizens,
    so far as we are concerned, is that it is, perhaps for the first time in
    history, an unselfish war. I could not be proud to fight for a selfish
    purpose, but I can be proud to fight for mankind. If they wish peace let
    them come forward through accredited representatives and lay their terms on
    the table. We have laid ours and they know what they are.</p>

    <p>But behind all this grim purpose, my friends, lies the opportunity to
    demonstrate not only force, which will be demonstrated to the utmost, but
    the opportunity to demonstrate character, and it is that opportunity that
    we have most conspicuously in the work of the Red Cross. Not that our men
    in arms do not represent our character, for they do, and it is a character
    which those who see and realize appreciate and admire; but their duty is
    the duty of force. The duty of the Red Cross is the duty of mercy and
    succor and friendship.</p>

    <h3><a id="WHAT_THE_WAR_IS_DOING" name="WHAT_THE_WAR_IS_DOING"></a>WHAT THE
    WAR IS DOING</h3>

    <p>Have you formed a picture in your imagination of what this war is doing
    for us and for the world? In my own mind I am convinced that not a hundred
    years of peace could have knitted this nation together as this single year
    of war has knitted it together, and better even than that, if possible, it
    is knitting the world together. Look at the picture. In the centre of the
    scene, four nations engaged against the world, and at every point of
    vantage, showing that they are seeking selfish aggrandizement; and, against
    them, twenty-three Governments representing the greater part of the
    population of the world, drawn together into a new sense of community of
    interest, a new sense of community of purpose,<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_138" name="Page_138">[Pg 138]</a></span> sense of unity of life. The
    Secretary of War told me an interesting incident the other day. He said
    when he was in Italy a member of the Italian Government was explaining to
    him the many reasons why Italy felt near to the United States.</p>

    <p>He said: "If you want to try an interesting experiment go up to any one
    of these troop trains and ask in English how many of them have been in
    America, and see what happens." He tried the experiment. He went up to a
    troop train and he said, "How many of you boys have been in America?" and
    he said it seemed to him as if half of them sprang up. "Me from San
    Francisco"; "Me from New York"; all over. There was part of the heart of
    America in the Italian Army. People that had been knitted to us by
    association, who knew us, who had lived among us, who had worked shoulder
    to shoulder with us, and now friends of America, were fighting for their
    native Italy.</p>

    <p>Friendship is the only cement that will ever hold the world together.
    And this intimate contact of the great Red Cross with the peoples who are
    suffering the terrors and deprivations of this war is going to be one of
    the greatest instrumentalities of friendship that the world ever knew, and
    the centre of the heart of it all, if we sustain it properly, will be this
    land that we so dearly love.</p>

    <h3><a id="SERVICE_BY_GIVING" name="SERVICE_BY_GIVING"></a>SERVICE BY
    GIVING</h3>

    <p>My friends, a great day of duty has come, and duty finds a man's soul as
    no kind of work can ever find it. May I say this? The duty that faces us
    all now is to serve one another, and no man can afford to make a fortune
    out of this war. There are men among us who have forgotten that, if they
    ever saw it. Some of you are old enough—I am old enough—to remember men who
    made fortunes out of the civil war, and you know how they were regarded by
    their fellow-citizens. That was a war to save one country—this is a war to
    save the world. And your relation to the Red Cross is one of the relations
    which will relieve you of the stigma. You can't give anything to the
    Government of the United States; it won't accept it. There is a law of
    Congress against accepting even services without pay. The only thing that
    the Government will accept is a loan, and duties performed; but it is a
    great deal better to give than to lend or to pay, and your great channel
    for giving is the American Red Cross.</p>

    <p>Down in your hearts you can't take very much satisfaction in the last
    analysis in lending money to the Government of the United States, because
    the interest which you draw will burn your pockets, it is a commercial
    transaction, and some men have even dared to cavil at the rate of interest,
    not knowing the incidental commentary that constitutes upon their
    attitude.</p>

    <p>But when you give, something of your something of your soul, something
    of yourself goes with the gift, particularly when it is given in such form
    that it never can come back by way of direct benefit to yourself. You know
    there is the old cynical definition of gratitude as "the lively expectation
    of favors to come." Well, there is no expectation of favors to come in this
    kind of giving. These things are bestowed in order that the world may be a
    fitter place to live in, that men may be succored, that homes may be
    restored, that suffering may be relieved, that the face of the earth may
    have the blight of destruction taken away from it, and that wherever force
    goes there shall go mercy and helpfulness.</p>

    <p>And when you give, give absolutely all that you can spare, and don't
    consider yourself liberal in the giving. If you give with self-adulation,
    you are not giving at all, you are giving to your own vanity; but if you
    give until it hurts, then your heartblood goes with it.</p>

    <h3><a id="INTERNATIONAL_ORGANIZATION" name=
    "INTERNATIONAL_ORGANIZATION"></a>INTERNATIONAL ORGANIZATION</h3>

    <p>And think what we have here! We call it the American Red Cross, but it
    is merely a branch of a great international organization, which is not only
    recognized by the statutes of each of the civilized Governments of the
    world, but it is recognized by international agreement and treaty, as the
    recognized and accepted instrumentality of mercy and succor. And one of the
    deepest stains that rests upon the reputation of the German Army is that
    they have not respected the Red Cross.</p>

    <p>That goes to the root of the matter. They have not respected the
    instrumentality they themselves participated in setting up as the thing
    which no man was to touch, because it was the expression of common
    humanity. We are members, by being members of the American Red Cross, of a
    great fraternity and comradeship which extends all over the world, and this
    cross which these ladies bore today is an emblem of Christianity
    itself.</p>

    <p>It fills my imagination, ladies and gentlemen, to think of the women all
    over this country who are busy tonight and are busy every night and every
    day doing the work of the Red Cross, busy with a great eagerness to find
    out the most serviceable thing to do, busy with a forgetfulness of all the
    old frivolities of their social relationships, ready to curtail the duties
    of the household in order that they may contribute to this common work that
    all their hearts are engaged in, and in doing which their hearts become
    acquainted with each other.</p>

    <p>When you think of this, you realize how the people of the United States
    are being drawn together into a great intimate family whose heart is being
    used for the service of the soldiers not only, but for the service of
    civilians, where they suffer and are lost in a maze of distresses and
    distractions. And you have, then, this noble picture of justice and mercy
    as the two servants of liberty. For only where men are free do they think
    the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_139" name="Page_139">[Pg
    139]</a></span> thoughts of comradeship; only where they are free do they
    think the thoughts of sympathy; only where they are free are they mutually
    helpful; only where they are free do they realize their dependence upon one
    another and their comradeship in a common interest and common
    necessity.</p>

    <h3><a id="MAKING_THE_WORLD_DEMOCRATIC" name=
    "MAKING_THE_WORLD_DEMOCRATIC"></a>MAKING THE WORLD DEMOCRATIC</h3>

    <p>I heard a story told the other day that was ridiculous, but it is worth
    repeating, because it contains the germ of truth. An Indian was enlisted in
    the army. He returned to the reservation on a furlough. He was asked what
    he thought of it. He said: "No much good; too much salute; not much shoot."
    Then he was asked: "Are you going back?" "Yes." "Well, do you know what you
    are fighting for?" "Yes, me know; fight to make whole damn world Democratic
    Party." He had evidently misunderstood some innocent sentence of my
    own.</p>

    <p>But, after all, although there is no party purpose in it, he got it
    right as far as the word "party"—to make the whole world democratic in the
    sense of community of interest and of purpose; and if you ladies and
    gentlemen could read some of the touching dispatches which come through
    official channels, for even through those channels there come voices of
    humanity that are infinitely pathetic; if you could catch some of those
    voices that speak the utter longing of oppressed and helpless peoples all
    over the world, to hear something like the "Battle Hymn of the Republic,"
    to hear the feet of the great hosts of liberty going to set them free, to
    set their minds free, set their lives free, set their children free, you
    would know what comes into the heart of those who are trying to contribute
    all the brains and power they have to this great enterprise of liberty.</p>

    <p>I summon you to the comradeship. I summon you in this next week to say
    how much and how sincerely and how unanimously you sustain the heart of the
    world.</p>

    <h2><a id="Address_on_Revenue_Legislation" name=
    "Address_on_Revenue_Legislation"></a>Address on Revenue Legislation</h2>

    <p class="center">[<span class="smcap">Delivered Before Congress May 27,
    1918, by President Wilson</span>]</p>

    <p>It is with unaffected reluctance that I come to ask you to prolong your
    session long enough to provide more adequate resources for the Treasury for
    the conduct of the war. I have reason to appreciate as fully as you do how
    arduous the session has been. Your labors have been severe and protracted.
    You have passed a long series of measures which required the debate of many
    doubtful questions of judgment and many exceedingly difficult questions of
    principle, as well as of practice. The Summer is upon us, in which labor
    and counsel are twice arduous and are constantly apt to be impaired by
    lassitude and fatigue. The elections are at hand, and we ought as soon as
    possible to go and render an intimate account of our trusteeship to the
    people who delegated us to act for them in the weighty and anxious matters
    that crowd upon us in these days of critical choice and action. But we dare
    not go to the elections until we have done our duty to the full. These are
    days when duty stands stark and naked, and even with closed eyes we know it
    is there. Excuses are unavailing. We have either done our duty or we have
    not. The fact will be as gross and plain as the duty itself. In such a case
    lassitude and fatigue seem negligible enough. The facts are tonic and
    suffice to freshen the labor.</p>

    <p>And the facts are these: Additional revenues must manifestly be provided
    for. It would be a most unsound policy to raise too large a proportion of
    them by loan, and it is evident that the $4,000,000,000 now provided for by
    taxation will not of themselves sustain the greatly enlarged budget to
    which we must immediately look forward. We cannot in fairness wait until
    the end of the fiscal year is at hand to apprise our people of the taxes
    they must pay on their earnings of the present calendar year, whose
    accountings and expenditures will then be closed. We cannot get increased
    taxes unless the country knows what they are to be and practices the
    necessary economy to make them available. Definiteness, early definiteness,
    as to what its tasks are to be is absolutely necessary for the successful
    administration of the Treasury. It cannot frame fair and workable
    regulations in haste; and it must frame its regulations in haste if it is
    not to know its exact task until the very eve of its performance. The
    present tax laws are marred, moreover, by inequities which ought to be
    remedied. Indisputable facts, every one; and we cannot alter or blink them.
    To state them is argument enough.</p>

    <h3><a id="WAR_PROFITS_AND_LUXURIES" name=
    "WAR_PROFITS_AND_LUXURIES"></a>WAR PROFITS AND LUXURIES</h3>

    <p>And yet, perhaps, you will permit me to dwell for a moment upon the
    situation they disclose. Enormous loans freely spent in the stimulation of
    industry of almost every sort produce inflations and extravagances which
    presently make the whole economic structure questionable and insecure, and
    the very basis of credit is cut away. Only fair, equitably distributed
    taxation of the widest incidents and drawing chiefly from the sources which
    would be likely to demoralize credit by their very abundance can prevent
    inflation and keep our industrial system free of speculation and waste. We
    shall naturally turn, therefore, I suppose, to war profits and incomes and
    luxuries for the additional taxes. But the war profits and incomes upon
    which the increased taxes will be levied will be the profits and incomes of
    the calendar year 1918.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_140" name=
    "Page_140">[Pg 140]</a></span> It would be manifestly unfair to wait until
    the early months of 1919 to say what they are to be. It might be difficult,
    I should imagine, to run the mill with water that had already gone over the
    wheel.</p>

    <p>Moreover, taxes of that sort will not be paid until June of next year,
    and the Treasury must anticipate them. It must use the money they are to
    produce before it is due. It must sell short-time certificates of
    indebtedness. In the Autumn a much larger sale of long-time bonds must be
    effected than has yet been attempted. What are the bankers to think of the
    certificates if they do not certainly know where the money is to come from
    which is to take them up? and how are investors to approach the purchase of
    bonds with any sort of confidence or knowledge of their own affairs if they
    do not know what taxes they are to pay and what economies and adjustments
    of their business they must effect? I cannot assure the country of a
    successful administration of the Treasury in 1918 if the question of
    further taxation is to be left undecided until 1919.</p>

    <p>The consideration that dominates every other now, and makes every other
    seem trivial and negligible, is the winning of the war. We are not only in
    the midst of the war, we are at the very peak and crisis of it. Hundreds of
    thousands of our men, carrying our hearts with them and our fortunes, are
    in the field, and ships are crowding faster and faster to the ports of
    France and England with regiment after regiment, thousand after thousand,
    to join them until the enemy shall be beaten and brought to a reckoning
    with mankind. There can be no pause or intermission. The great enterprise
    must, on the contrary, be pushed with greater and greater energy. The
    volume of our might must steadily and rapidly be augmented until there can
    be no question of resisting it. If that is to be accomplished, gentlemen,
    money must sustain it to the utmost. Our financial program must no more be
    left in doubt or suffered to lag than our ordnance program or our ship
    program or our munition program or our program for making millions of men
    ready. These others are not programs, indeed, but mere plans upon paper,
    unless there is to be an unquestionable supply of money.</p>

    <h3><a id="A_TAX_ON_PROFITEERING" name="A_TAX_ON_PROFITEERING"></a>A TAX ON
    PROFITEERING</h3>

    <p>That is the situation, and it is the situation which creates the duty;
    no choice or preference of ours. There is only one way to meet that duty.
    We must meet it without selfishness or fear of consequences. Politics is
    adjourned. The elections will go to those who thing[?think?] least of it;
    to those who go to the constituencies without explanations or excuses, with
    a plain record of duty faithfully and disinterestedly performed. I for one,
    am always confident that the people of this country will give a just
    verdict upon the service of the men who act for them when the facts such
    that no man can disguise or conceal them. There is no danger of deceit now.
    An intense and pitiless light beats upon every man and every action in this
    tragic plot of war that is now upon the stage. If lobbyists hurry to
    Washington to attempt to turn what you do in the matter of taxation to
    their protection or advantage, the light will beat also upon them. There is
    abundant fuel for the light in the records of the Treasury with regard to
    profits of every sort. The profiteering that cannot be got at by the
    restraints of conscience and love of country can be got at by taxation.
    There is such profiteering now, and the information with regard to it is
    available and indisputable.</p>

    <p>I am advising you to act upon this matter of taxation now, gentlemen,
    not because I do not know that you can see and interpret the facts and the
    duty they impose just as well and with as clear a perception of the
    obligation involved as I can, but because there is a certain solemn
    satisfaction in sharing with you the responsibilities of such a time. The
    world never stood in such a case before. Men never before had so clear and
    so moving a vision of duty. I know that you will begrudge the work to be
    done here by us no more than the men begrudge us theirs who lie in the
    trenches and sally forth to their death. There is a stimulating comradeship
    knitting us all together. And this task to which I invite your immediate
    consideration will be performed under favorable influences, if we will look
    to what the country is thinking and expecting and care nothing at all for
    what is being said and believed in the lobbies of Washington hotels, where
    the atmosphere seems to make it possible to believe what is believed
    nowhere else.</p>

    <h3><a id="SPIRIT_OF_THE_NATION" name="SPIRIT_OF_THE_NATION"></a>SPIRIT OF
    THE NATION</h3>

    <p>Have you not felt the spirit of the nation rise and its thought become a
    single and common thought since these eventful days came in which we have
    been sending our boys to the other side? I think you must read that
    thought, as I do, to mean this, that the people of this country are not
    only united in the resolute purpose to win this war, but are ready and
    willing to bear any burden and undergo any sacrifice that it may be
    necessary for them to bear in order to win it. We need not be afraid to tax
    them, if we lay taxes justly. They know that the war must be paid for, that
    it is they who must pay for it, and, if the burden is justly distributed
    and the sacrifice made a common sacrifice from which none escapes who can
    bear it at all, they will carry it cheerfully and with a sort of solemn
    pride. I have always been proud to be an American, and was never more proud
    than now, when all that we have said and all that we have foreseen about
    our people is coming true. The great days have come when the only thing
    that they ask for or admire is duty, greatly and adequately. done; when
    their only wish for<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_141" name=
    "Page_141">[Pg 141]</a></span> America is that she may share the freedom
    she enjoys, when a great, compelling sympathy wells up in their hearts for
    men everywhere who suffer and are oppressed, and when they see at last the
    high uses for which their wealth has been piled up and their mighty power
    accumulated, and, counting neither blood nor treasure, now that their final
    day of opportunity has come, rejoice to spend and to be spent through a
    long night of suffering and terror in order that they and men everywhere
    may see the dawn of a day of righteousness and justice and peace. Shall we
    grow weary when they bid us act?</p>

    "The_Presidents_Appeal_for_Economy"></a>The President's Appeal for
    Economy</h2>

    <p><i>Secretary McAdoo, realizing that to carry the war through to a
    successful issue may test this nation's resources to the extreme limit of
    endurance and self-denial, inaugurated a campaign in the middle of May,
    1918, for fuller conservation of food, fuel, labor, and money. In support
    of this campaign President Wilson issued the following signed letter on May
    29</i>:</p>

    <p>This war is one of nations—not of armies—and all of our 100,000,000
    people must be economically and industrially adjusted to war conditions if
    this nation is to play its full part in the conflict. The problem before us
    is not primarily a financial problem, but rather a problem of increased
    production of war essentials, and the saving of the materials and the labor
    necessary for the support and equipment of our army and our navy.
    Thoughtless expenditure of money for nonessentials uses up the labor of
    men, the products of the farm, mines, and factories, and overburdens
    transportation, all of which must be used to the utmost and at their best
    for war purposes.</p>

    <p>The great results which we seek can be obtained only by the
    participation of every member of the nation, young and old, in a national
    concerted thrift movement. I therefore urge that our people everywhere
    pledge themselves, as suggested by the Secretary of the Treasury, to the
    practice of thrift; to serve the Government to their utmost in increasing
    production in all fields necessary to the winning of the war; to conserve
    food and fuel and useful materials of every kind; to devote their labor
    only to the most necessary tasks; and to buy only those things which are
    essential to individual health and efficiency; and that the people, as
    evidence of their loyalty, invest all that they can save in Liberty bonds
    and war savings stamps.</p>

    <p>The securities issued by the Treasury Department are so many of them
    within the reach of every one that the door of opportunity in this matter
    is wide open to all of us. To practice thrift in peace times is a virtue
    and brings great benefit to the individual at all times; with the desperate
    need of the civilized world today for materials and labor with which to end
    the war, the practice of individual thrift is a patriotic duty and a
    necessity.</p>

    <p>I appeal to all who now own either Liberty bonds or war savings stamps
    to continue to practice economy and thrift and to appeal to all who do not
    own Government securities to do likewise and purchase them to the extent of
    their means. The man who buys Government securities transfers the
    purchasing power of his money to the United States Government until after
    this war, and to that same degree does not buy in competition with the
    Government.</p>

    <p>I earnestly appeal to every man, woman, and child to pledge themselves
    on or before the 28th of June to save constantly and to buy as regularly as
    possible the securities of the Government; and to do this, so far as
    possible, through membership in war savings societies. The 28th of June
    ends this special period of enlistment in the great volunteer army of
    production and saving here at home. May there be none unenlisted on that
    day!</p>

    see and love the truth, to accept and defend all things that are just and
    right, and to purpose only those righteous acts and judgments which are in

    President's Pledge</h3>

    <p>President Wilson delivered the following important speech to a
    delegation of Mexican editors at the White House June 7, 1918:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I have never received a group of men who were more welcome than you
        are because it has been one of my distresses during the period of my
        Presidency that the Mexican people did not more thoroughly understand
        the attitude of the United States toward Mexico. I think I can assure
        you, and I hope you have had every evidence of the truth of my
        assurance, that that attitude is one of sincere friendship—not merely
        the sort of friendship which prompts one not to do his neighbor any
        harm, but the sort of friendship which earnestly desires to do his
        neighbor service.</p>

        <p>My own policy and the policy of my own Administration toward Mexico
        was at every point based upon this principle; that the internal
        settlement of the affairs of Mexico was none of our business; that we
        had no right to interfere with or dictate to Mexico in any particular
        with regard to her own affairs.</p>

        <p>Take one aspect of our relations which at one time may have been
        difficult for you to understand. When we sent our troops into Mexico
        our sincere desire was nothing else than to assist you to get rid of
        the man who was making the settlement of your affairs for the time
        being impossible. We had no desire to use our troops for any other
        purpose, and I was in hopes that by assisting in that way and thereupon
        immediately withdrawing the troops I might give you substantial proof
        of the truth of the assurances that I had given your Government through
        President Carranza.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>And at the present time it distresses me to learn that certain
        influences, which I assume to be German in their origin, are trying not
        only to make a wrong impression, but to give an absolutely untrue
        account of the things that happen.</p>

        <p>You know distressing things have been happening just off our coast;
        you know of vessels that have been sunk. I yesterday received a
        quotation from a paper in Guadalajara which stated that thirteen of our
        battleships had been sunk off the Capes of Chesapeake.</p>

        <p>You see how dreadful it is to have the people so radically
        misinformed. It was added that our Navy Department was withholding the
        facts with regard to these sinkings. I <span class="pagenum"><a id=
        "Page_143" name="Page_143">[Pg 143]</a></span>have no doubt that the
        publisher of the paper printed this in perfect innocence and without
        intending to convey a wrong impression, but it is evident that
        allegations of that sort proceed from those who wish to make trouble
        between Mexico and the United States.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Now, gentlemen, for the time being at any rate, and I hope that it
        will not be a short time, the influence of the United States is
        somewhat pervasive in the affairs of the world, and I believe it is
        pervasive because those nations of the world which are less powerful
        than some of the greatest nations are coming to believe that our
        sincere desire is to do disinterested service.</p>

        <p>We are the champions of those nations which have not had the
        military standing which would enable them to compete with the strongest
        nations in the world, and I look forward with pride to the time which I
        hope will come when we can give substantial evidence not only that we
        do not want anything out of this war, but that we would not accept
        anything out of this war; that it is absolutely a case of disinterested
        action.</p>

        <p>And if you will watch the attitude of our people you will see that
        nothing stirs them so deeply as the assurances that this war, so far as
        we are concerned, is for idealistic objects. One of the difficulties
        that I experienced during the first three years of the war, the years
        when the United States was not in the war, was in getting the Foreign
        Offices of the European nations to believe that the United States was
        seeking nothing for herself, that her neutrality was not selfish, and
        that if she came in she would not come in to get anything substantial
        out of the war—any material object, any territory or trade or anything
        else of that sort.</p>

        <p>In some Foreign Offices there were men who personally know me and
        they believed, I hope, that I was sincere in assuring them that our
        purposes were disinterested; but they thought that these assurances
        came from the academic gentleman removed from the ordinary sources of
        information and speaking the idealistic purposes of a cloister. They
        did not believe I was speaking the real heart of the American people,
        and I knew all along that I was. Now I believe every one who comes in
        contact with American people knows that I am speaking their
        purposes.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The other night in New York at the opening of the campaign for funds
        for our Red Cross I made an address. I had not intended to refer to
        Russia, but was speaking without notes, and in the course of what I
        said my own thought was led to Russia, and I said that we meant to
        stand by Russia just as firmly as we would stand by France or England
        or any other of our allies.</p>

        <p>The audience to which I was speaking was not an audience from which
        I would have expected an enthusiastic response to that. It was rather
        too well dressed. It was an audience, in other words, made up of a
        class of people who would not have the most intimate feeling for the
        sufferings of the ordinary man in Russia; but that audience jumped to
        its feet in enthusiasm. Nothing else that I said on that occasion
        aroused anything like the enthusiasm that single sentence aroused.</p>

        <p>Now that is a sample, gentlemen. We cannot make anything out of
        Russia. We cannot make anything out of our standing by Russia at this
        time—the remotest of European nations so far as we are concerned, the
        one with which we have had the least connections in trade and
        advantage—and yet the people of the United States rose to that
        suggestion as to no other that I made in that address.</p>

        <p>That is part of America as we are ready to show it by any act of
        friendship toward Mexico. Some of us, if I may speak so privately, look
        back with regret upon some of the more ancient relations that we have
        had with Mexico long before our generation; and America, if I may now
        so accept it, would now feel ashamed to take advantage of her
        neighbor.</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>So I hope you can carry back to your homes something better than
        assurances and words. You have had contact with our people. You know of
        your own personal reception. You know how gladly we have opened to you
        the doors of every establishment that you wanted to see and have shown
        you just what we are doing, and I hope you have gained the right
        impression as to why we are doing it. We are doing it, gentlemen, so
        that the world may never hereafter have to fear the only thing that any
        nation has to dread—the unjust and selfish aggression of another
        nation.</p>

        <p>Some time ago, as you probably all know, I proposed a sort of
        Pan-American agreement. I had perceived that one difficulty in our past
        relations with Latin America was this: The famous Monroe Doctrine was
        adopted without your consent and without the consent of any Central
        American or South American States. If I may adopt a term that we so
        often use in this country, we said: "We are going to be your big
        brother whether you want us to be or not."</p>

        <p>We did not ask whether it was agreeable to you that we should be
        your big brother. We said we are going to be. Now, that was all very
        well as far as protecting you from aggression from the other side of
        the water, but there was nothing in it that protected you from
        aggression from us, and I have repeatedly seen an uneasy feeling on the
        part of representatives of States of Central and South America that our
        self-appointed protection might be for our own benefit and our own
        interest and not for the interest of our neighbors. So I have said:</p>

        <p>"Very well, let us make an arrangement by which we will give bonds.
        Let us have a common guarantee that all of us will sign a declaration
        of political independence and territorial <span class="pagenum"><a id=
        "Page_144" name="Page_144">[Pg 144]</a></span>integrity. Let us agree
        that if any one of us, the United States included, violates the
        political independence or territorial integrity of any of the others,
        all others will jump on her."</p>

        <p>I pointed out to some gentlemen who were less inclined to enter into
        this arrangement than others that that was, in effect, giving bonds on
        the part of the United States that we would enter into an arrangement
        by which you would be protected from us.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="PEACE_BY_MUTUAL_TRUST" name="PEACE_BY_MUTUAL_TRUST"></a>PEACE BY
    MUTUAL TRUST</h3>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Now, that is the kind of agreement that will have to be the
        foundation of the future life of the nations of the world, gentlemen.
        The whole family of nations will have to guarantee to each nation that
        no nation shall violate its political independence or its territorial
        integrity. That is the basis—the only conceivable basis—for the future
        peace of the world, and I must admit that I was anxious to have the
        States of the two Continents of America show the way to the rest of the
        world as to how to make a basis of peace.</p>

        <p>Peace can only come by trust. If you can once get a situation of
        trust then you have got a situation of permanent peace. Therefore,
        every one of us, it seems to me, owes it as a patriotic duty to his own
        country to plant the seeds of trust and confidence instead of seeds of
        suspicion.</p>

        <p>That is the reason I began by saying to you that I had not had the
        pleasure of meeting a group of men who are more welcome than you are,
        because you are our near neighbors. Suspicion on your part, or
        misunderstanding on your part, distresses us more than we would be
        distressed by similar feelings on the part of those less near to
        us.</p>

        <p>It is you who can see how Mexico's future must depend upon peace and
        honor, so that nobody shall exploit her. It must depend upon every
        nation that has any relation with her and the citizens of any nation
        that has any relations with her keeping within the bounds of honor and
        fair dealing and justice, because so soon as you can admit your own
        capital and the capital of the world to the free use of the resources
        of Mexico it will be one of the most wonderfully rich and prosperous
        countries in the world.</p>

        <p>And when you have foundations of established order and the world has
        come to its senses again we shall, I hope, continue in connections that
        will assure us all permanent cordiality and friendship.</p>

    "Why_the_United_States_Is_at_War"></a>Why the United States Is at War</h3>

    <p>Robert Lansing, Secretary of State of the United States, delivered an
    address in New York on May 23, 1918, in honor of the third anniversary of
    Italy's entrance into the war. He said in part:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Oh, you of the blood of a people who have given so much to
        civilization, no greater task has ever fallen upon you, no greater duty
        has ever been the lot of the Italian race, than that which is yours
        today. You are called forth to defend the land which is enshrined in
        the hearts of the world as the cradle of justice and liberty. Fail you
        cannot, fail you must not, fail you will not in such a cause and such a
        crisis.</p>

        <p>This is no time to measure the price which must be paid in blood and
        treasure. No price is too large, no sacrifice too great for the
        protection of your sacred heritage from the invaders.</p>

        <p>Today, America, youngest of the great powers of the earth, is proud
        to cross the seas and to stand side by side with the most ancient power
        of Europe in upholding the standard of democracy, and to unite in
        proclaiming to the nations tortured by war that peace must be won and
        will be won by the might of liberty-loving men, a glorious peace which
        will endure throughout the ages because it is written in the book of
        destiny that freedom will rise triumphant from the ashes of this
        desolated world.</p>

        <p>To gallant Italy, to our loyal associate and friend, we of America
        extend greetings on this day of reconsecration to a noble cause, on
        this day when the Italian people renew their solemn pledge to resist to
        the uttermost the accursed ambitions of the military rulers of Germany
        and Austria.</p>

        <p>Italy's decision was the decision of a people who preferred the
        horrors of war to dishonor, who preferred to die rather than to be
        enslaved by Prussian masters or by Prussia's vassals. It breathed anew
        the valor of Rome.</p>

        <p>United with you of the Latin race are we who could desire no prouder
        title than "the Romans of the West." A citizen of this young Republic
        could crave no higher public virtue nor covet a more devoted patriotism
        than that which inspired a dweller on the Seven Hills in the brave days
        of the old Roman Republic.</p>

        <p>My friends of America and of Italy, we will win this war. It may be
        on the wasted fields of Flanders and Picardy; it may be in the valley
        of the Piave and the snow-crowned peaks of the Alps; or it may be on
        German lands beyond the Rhine. Somewhere and somehow and some time we
        will win. It cannot be otherwise, for we fight for justice, for
        liberty, and for humanity.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="AT_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY" name="AT_COLUMBIA_UNIVERSITY"></a>AT
    COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</h3>

    <p>Secretary Lansing delivered another address in New York on June 5 at the
    commencement exercises of Columbia University. In accepting an honorary
    degree from that institution he said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Today this Republic stands with the democracies of the earth arrayed
        in battle against the most relentless enemy of human liberty which the
        ages have produced. To save this country of ours and to save the
        civilized world from Prussianism has become the supreme duty of the
        American people and of all other peoples who love justice and
        freedom.</p>

        <p>In this titanic struggle we are joined not only with France, our
        historic ally, but also with Great Britain, our ancient foe. On the
        blood-stained fields of France we three, together with Italy, Belgium,
        and Portugal, are standing shoulder to shoulder against the plunderers.
        Our traditional friendship for France, which can never be forgotten,
        and our traditional enmity for Great Britain, which is forgotten, are
        swallowed up in this supreme crisis of liberty, our common heritage.
        The grave perils to our lives as nations unite us with bonds of steel
        as our armies face the foe of all mankind.</p>

        <p>I am proud that in these terrible days we are associated with the
        tenacious warriors of Britain; I am proud that with our blood we can on
        French soil prove the affection which we cherish for the French people;
        I am proud that Italy, superb in her determined resistance, is our
        partner in this conflict, and that the indomitable spirit of the
        Belgians and Serbs is a living inspiration to gallant deeds and noble
        sacrifice. I am proud, as I know every American is proud, to be thus
        united with the nations which hate Prussianism and loathe the evil
        desires which it engenders in the hearts of men.</p>

        <p>Prussianism has appealed to the sword, and by the sword Prussianism
        must fall. It is the divine law of retribution which we as the
        instruments of justice must enforce so that the world may be forever
        rid of this abomination. * * *</p>

        <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_146" name="Page_146">[Pg
        146]</a></span></p>

        <p>Let us understand that a Prussian-made peace would not be the end;
        that it would only postpone the final struggle. Now that this war has
        come upon us we must carry it through to a decision. We must not
        transmit to future generations the germs of militarism. From the spirit
        of despotism, which has caused this awful tragedy, this war must free
        the world. We have suffered enough. The nations must never endure such
        black days of agony as those in which we are living.</p>

        <p>It is the supreme task of civilization to put an end to Prussianism.
        To listen to proposals for a Prussian peace, to compromise with the
        butchers of individuals and of nations so that they would by agreement
        gain a benefit from their crimes would be to compound an international
        felony, which this Republic will never do.</p>

        <p>Force is the one way to end Prussianism, for it is the only thing
        which the Prussian respects. This war for democracy must be waged to a
        successful conclusion to make liberty and justice supreme on the earth.
        It will be a bitter struggle, with lights and shadows, for the foe is
        strong and stubborn; but in the end we shall triumph, for we must
        triumph or abandon all that is worth while in this world. May every
        American so live and so serve that when the day of victory over the
        Prussians dawns, as it will dawn, he may, by right of faithful service,
        share in the glory.</p>

        <p>To that bright hour let us look forward with confidence, for the
        Supreme Ruler of the Universe could not decree otherwise. He has
        imposed upon us and our brave comrades in arms the task of freeing
        mankind from the curse of avarice and inhumanity which besets us. He
        has put upon us the burden of making this world a fit dwelling place
        for civilized men. Let us not shrink from the task or seek to avoid the
        burden. Convinced of the righteousness of our cause and of our destiny
        let us make war with all our energy. Let us keep our banners unfurled
        and our trumpets sounding to battle until victory is achieved.</p>

        <p>Prussia wickedly sought war and Prussia shall have war and more war
        and more war until the very thought of war is abhorrent to the Prussian
        mind. So I read the spirit of America. So I read the supreme purpose of
        the Allies. Victory lies before us and beyond victory a just and
        enduring peace. Until that peace is sure America cannot and will not
        put aside the sword.</p>

    <h3><a id="ITALIAN_AMBASSADORS_SPEECH" name=
    "ITALIAN_AMBASSADORS_SPEECH"></a>ITALIAN AMBASSADOR'S SPEECH</h3>

    <p>Count Mocchi di Cellere, the Italian Ambassador to the United States, in
    his address at the Italian anniversary celebration, said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Literally speaking, this is the third anniversary of Italy's formal
        entry into the war. But perhaps I need not remind you, gentlemen, that
        our struggle against the enemy goes back to the time when, some twenty
        centuries ago, on those selfsame fields and mountains that are now a
        part of our common allied front, the Roman eagle was already waging
        that fight against the barbarians in which the American eagle has more
        recently joined us.</p>

        <p>The struggle of today is to us Italians the rounding-out of a
        tremendous cycle of world history, in which, alone of all civilized
        nations, Italy was in at the beginning and is in at the finish. Since
        the time when Roman law laid the foundations for the international
        intercourse of the world, the struggle has gone on against Teutonic
        brutality. We are in it as a nation with all the traditions and
        survivals of centuries, with all the memories of the race, with all the
        influences of obscure ancestral heredities.</p>

        <p>One verse of our national hymn reminds us that no Teuton stick ever
        curbed Italy, and that the children of Rome do not bow their necks to a
        yoke. That was the blunder of the enemy—he did not realize that to a
        liberty-loving people the spirit of freedom is like the breathing of
        pure air, an essential of life. Sometimes a man does not know how
        essential it is until some one tries to take it from him. Then he must
        die or revolt. Italy revolted. * * *</p>

        <p>Whatever the enemy may have to say or may desire others to believe
        about it, Italy is not in this war for any base and selfish motives of
        conquest, imperial or unlawful territorial aggrandizement. While in
        fact fighting for the liberation of mankind threatened with oppression
        and slavery, Italy is aiming at the liberation of her oppressed sons
        within and beyond the boundary imposed upon her by an iniquitous
        treaty.</p>

        <p>For the freedom of our country we need security on land and sea; a
        security which nature herself had assured us with well defined
        geographic boundaries and which the violence of oppressive and
        barbarous nations has too long stolen from us. Now we see our duty
        clear; and faithful to our duty, we will not lay down our arms until
        the freedom of mankind, which implies the freedom of our oppressed
        brothers, and the security of our land, is attained.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Secretary Lansing delivered the chief address at the commencement
    exercises of Union College, Schenectady, N. Y., June 10. He said in
    part:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>It is hardly open to debate, in the light of<span class=
        "pagenum"><a id="Page_147" name="Page_147">[Pg 147]</a></span>
        subsequent events, that the philosophical and political ideas which
        have been taught for years from the university platforms, from the
        pulpits, and through the printed word to young and old in Germany,
        excited in them an insolent pride of blood and infused into their
        national being an all-absorbing ambition to prove themselves supermen
        chosen by natural superiority and by Divine mandate to be rulers of the
        earth. Not only in Germany, but among those of German descent in other
        lands, has this pernicious belief spread, linking Germans everywhere to
        the Fatherland in the hope that they would be considered worthy to
        share in the future glory of the masters of the world. * * *</p>

        <p>A decade before the war Reiner, inspired with the imperialism of
        Prussia, announced: "It is precisely our craving for expansion which
        drives us into the paths of conquest, in view of which all chatter
        about peace and humanity can and must remain nothing but chatter."</p>

        <p>Not less ominous to liberty are the words of Professor Meinecke: "We
        want to become a world people. Let us remind ourselves that the belief
        in our mission as a world people has arisen from our originally purely
        spiritual impulse to absorb the world into ourselves."</p>

        <p>Observe that extraordinary phrase, "to absorb the world into
        ourselves." To conceive such a national destiny is to resurrect the
        dead ambitions of an Alexander or a Caesar; to teach it as a right to
        young men is to sow in their minds an egotism which breeds distorted
        conceptions of individual honor and justice, and gives to them an
        utterly false standard of national life.</p>

        <p>Not alone from the lecturer and the essayist came this idea that the
        Germans are a superior race set apart to rule the world. It was
        preached in the pulpits as a Divine truth by those who even had the
        effrontery to support their assertions by references to the Holy
        Scriptures. Listen to some of the thoughts proclaimed by ordained
        ministers of Christ to their German congregations:</p>

        <p>"It may sound proud, my friends, but we are conscious that it is
        also in all humbleness that we say it; the German soul is God's soul;
        it shall and will rule over mankind."</p>

        <p>May we be spared the consequences of a German "humbleness" which
        fairly struts and swaggers, and which finds further expression in the
        words of another Doctor of Divinity when he declares: "Verily the Bible
        is our book. It was given and assigned to us, and in it we read the
        original text of our destiny, which proclaims to mankind salvation or
        disaster as we will it."</p>

        <p>"As we will it!" There in four words is the whole story of the
        Prussian doctrine of the "superman," of a "place in the sun."</p>

        <p>Paganism, tinctured with modern materialism and a degenerate type of
        Christianity, broods today over Germany. Christian ministers have
        proclaimed Jehovah to be the national deity of the empire, a
        monopolized German God, who relies on the physical might of His people
        to destroy those who oppose His will as that will is interpreted by His
        chosen race. Thus the Prussian leaders would harmonize modern thought
        with their ancient religion of physical strength through brutalizing
        Christianity.</p>

        <p>In view of the spirit of hypocrisy and bad faith manifesting an
        entire lack of conscience, we ought not to be astonished that the
        Berlin Foreign Office never permitted a promise or a treaty engagement
        to stand in the way of a course of action which the German Government
        deemed expedient. I need not cite as proof of this fact the flagrant
        violations of the treaty neutralizing Belgium—and the recent treaty of
        Brest-Litovsk. This discreditable characteristic of the German foreign
        policy was accepted by German diplomats as a matter of course and as a
        natural if not a praiseworthy method of dealing with other
        Governments.</p>

        <p>Frederick the Great, with cynical frankness, once said: "If there is
        anything to be gained by it, we will be honest. If deception is
        necessary, let us be cheats." That is in brief the immoral principle
        which has controlled the foreign relations of Prussia for over 150
        years.</p>

        <p>It is a fact not generally known that within six weeks after the
        Imperial Government had, in the case of the Sussex, given to this
        Government its solemn promise that it would cease ruthless slaughter on
        the high seas, Count Bernstorff, appreciating the worthlessness of the
        promise, asked the Berlin Foreign Office to advise him in ample time
        before the campaign of submarine murder was renewed, in order that he
        might notify the German merchant ships in American ports to destroy
        their machinery because he anticipated that the renewal of that method
        of warfare would in all probability bring the United States into the
        war.</p>

        <p>How well the Ambassador knew the character of his Government, and
        how perfectly frank he was! He asked for the information without
        apology or indirection. The very bluntness of his message shows that he
        was sure that his superiors would not take offense at the assumption
        that their word was valueless and had only been given to gain time, and
        that, when an increase of Germany's submarine fleet warranted, the
        promise <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_148" name="Page_148">[Pg
        148]</a></span>would be broken without hesitation or compunction. What
        a commentary on Bernstorff's estimate of the sense of honor and good
        faith of his own Government!</p>

        <p>We must go on with the war. There is no other way. This task must
        not be left half done. We must not transmit to posterity a legacy of
        blood and misery. We may in this great conflict go down into the Valley
        of Shadows, because our foe is powerful and inured to war. We must be
        prepared to meet disappointment and temporary reverse, but we must,
        with American spirit, rise above them; with courageous hearts we must
        go forward until this war is won.</p>

    Americans</h2>

    <p>David Lloyd George, the British Premier, speaking at the Printers'
    Pension Fund dinner in London, June 7, 1918, paid this tribute to the
    American soldiers in France:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I have only just returned from France, and met a French statesman
        who had been at the front shortly after a battle in which the Americans
        took part. He was full of admiration not merely of their superb valor
        but of the trained skill with which they attacked and defeated the
        foe.</p>

        <p>His report of the conduct of the American troops, a division that
        had been in action for the first time, was one of the most encouraging
        things I have heard, because they are coming in steadily. There is a
        great flow, and we are depending upon them, and the fact that we know
        that when they appear in the battleline they will fight in a way which
        is worthy of the great traditions of their great country is in itself a
        source of support and sustenance and encouragement to all of those who
        with anxious hearts are watching the conflict which is going on in
        France.</p>

        <p>The toast with which you have done me the honor to associate my name
        is "Success to the Allied Cause." If for any cause the Allies were not
        to succeed, it would be a sorry world to live in. Most times people are
        inclined to exaggerate events of the day, but there are occasions when
        generations of men underestimate the significance of events. You cannot
        exaggerate the importance or significance of the issues with which we
        are confronted today.</p>

        <p>In the past you have had in the history of the world great struggles
        for domination of a certain civilization, a certain ideal or a certain
        religion, and the fate of the world and the destiny of man and the
        lives of untold millions for generations have been fashioned upon the
        triumph or failure of this cause. Take the time of Turkish military
        power in the past or the Saracens' attempt to trample down and overrun
        the civilization of the West. Nations were wiped out, great countries
        devastated. You had untold misery and wretchedness throughout vast
        tracts of territory for ages. At last that tide was stemmed. Supposing
        that had failed. What a difference it would have made for European
        civilization today!</p>

        <p>At this hour there is a struggle with an ideal more material, more
        sordid, more brutal, than almost any other which has been sought to be
        imposed upon Europe—the Prussian military ideal, with its contempt for
        liberty, its contempt for human right, its contempt for humanity. If
        they were to succeed today, you would fling back human civilization
        into the dark dungeons of the past.</p>

        <p>The crisis is not past, but with a stout heart we shall win through,
        and then woe to the plague. In the interests of civilization, in the
        interests of the human race, it must be stamped out. You cannot allow
        it to come again to darken the lives of millions, and to desolate
        millions of homes. That is what we are fighting for.</p>

        <p>This is a country which has faced a great crisis in the past. We
        hear about Ludendorff's hammer blows. Hammer blows crack and crumble
        poor material. Hammer blows harden and consolidate good metal. There is
        good metal in British hearts. It has stood the test of centuries. It
        will stand this. So will that gallant little people, that gallant great
        people across the Channel who are fighting for their liberties, for the
        honor of their native land, fighting without flinching. I have seen
        them. I never saw signs of wavering in any French face. They are full
        of courage, full of determination to fight through to the end, and it
        is a united France more than ever. So it is a united Britain. Unity and
        resolution are two qualities we need. We have sunk our political
        differences. We have bigger things to think about. I am not despising
        the political controversies of the past. In some form or another they
        will come again. These controversies are the very essence of freedom,
        but for the moment we have one purpose.</p>

        <p>Let us be one people, one in aim, one in courage, one in the resolve
        never to give in. Let Britain stand like a breakwater against the
        torrent, and, God willing, we will break it in two.</p>

    <h2><a id="Clemenceaus_Defiance_of_Obstructors" name=
    "Clemenceaus_Defiance_of_Obstructors"></a>Clemenceau's Defiance of
    Obstructors</h2>

    <p>Premier Clemenceau of France received a vote of confidence in the
    Chamber of Deputies on June 6, 1918, by a vote of 377 to 110. An attempt
    was made by the militant Socialists to embarrass the Government by
    demanding information of military matters which it was deemed inexpedient
    to reveal. In his victorious speech defying his critics he said:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The collapse of Russia enabled the enemy to set free an army of a
        million men to add to his forces on our front. Anybody can understand
        that under such enormous weight our line must give way at some points.
        Some of our men have fought one against five without sleeping for three
        or four days. The losses of our allies, the British, in the heroic
        struggle have been more than we could have believed possible.</p>

        <p>The situation has become dangerous for our armies, but in all this I
        see nothing to diminish our confidence in our troops. As to the
        Government, it will continue to make war stubbornly and obstinately. We
        will never capitulate. If you are not satisfied with our work, turn us
        out. It is for you to decide.</p>

        <p>The only thing that matters is final success. Our effectives are
        lessening in number, but so are those of Germany, while the Americans
        are coming in larger and larger numbers to take part in the final
        victory. * * *</p>

        <p>Down there all that the heroes can do is to die, but you by your
        firm and resolute attitude can give them what they deserve—victory. You
        have before you a Government which told you the very first day that it
        did not enter into power to negotiate without victory. As long as we
        are here the fatherland will be defended at all costs, and no force
        will be spared to obtain success.</p>

        <p>We have allies who represent the greatest nations in the world, that
        have decided to go on until success is certain, success which is near.
        The Americans are arriving for the final blow.</p>

    <h2><a id="Brute_Force_Versus_Humanity" name=
    "Brute_Force_Versus_Humanity"></a>Brute Force Versus Humanity</h2>

    <p class="center">By MAURICE MAETERLINCK</p>

    <p class="center">[Translated for <span class="smcap">Current History
    Magazine</span> from Les Annales, Paris]</p>

    <p>The struggle of today is only a resumption of the conflict that has
    never ceased to redden the soil of Western Europe ever since its birth into
    history. The two chief episodes of this conflict, as everybody knows, are
    the invasion of Roman Gaul (including Northern Italy) by the Germans, and
    the conquest of Great Britain by the Anglo-Saxons and the Normans. Ignoring
    questions of race, which are complex, uncertain, and always debatable, one
    can, by viewing the subject from another point, see in the persistence and
    desperation of this war the conflict of two wills, either one of which
    succumbs for a moment only to rise again with more energy and
    determination.</p>

    <p>On one side there is the will of earth, or of nature, which openly, in
    the human species, as in all others, favors physical and brutal force; on
    the other, the will of humanity, or at least of a part of humanity that is
    seeking to establish the reign of other energies more subtile and less
    animal. It is incontestable that brute force thus far has always triumphed.
    But it is equally certain that it has never triumphed save in appearance
    and for a brief moment. Gaul, invaded and overcome, quickly assimiliated
    the invaders, and England gradually transformed her conquerors. The
    instruments of the will of earth turned against it on the morrow of victory
    and armed the hand of the vanquished.</p>

    <p>It is probable that, even today, if events followed the course
    prescribed by destiny, the same phenomenon would be reproduced. Germany,
    after having crushed and enslaved the greater part of Europe, throwing it
    back and overwhelming it with numberless evils, would herself end by
    turning against the will which she represents; and that will, which
    hitherto had found a docile instrument and a chosen accomplice in the
    German race, would be obliged to find these elsewhere, a task less easy
    than formerly.</p>

    <p>But now, to the stupefaction of those who will some day examine this
    epoch dispassionately, behold, events are suddenly moving upward against
    the irresistible current, and, for the first time since man is in a
    position to observe it, brute force is meeting an unexpected and
    insurmountable resistance. If this resistance remains victorious to the
    end, there will, perhaps, never have been a change of course comparable to
    it in the history of man; it will mean a triumph over the will of earth, of
    nature, or of fate, a triumph infinitely more significant, more heavy with
    consequences, and perhaps more decisive, than all those which in other
    domains appear to have crowned our effort with more glory.</p>

    <p>Let us be not at all astonished, then, that the resistance is enormous
    and prolonged beyond all that experience of war has taught us. Our prompt
    and easy defeat was written in the annals of destiny. We had against us all
    the force of aggression acquired since the origin of Europe. We have to
    reverse the wheel of history. We are on the point of succeeding; and if it
    is true that intelligent beings on the heights of other worlds are watching
    us, they are doubtless contemplating the most curious spectacle that our
    planet has offered them since they discovered it in the star dust
    scintillating around them in space. They must be saying to themselves,
    disconcerted, that age-long and fundamental laws are being unexpectedly
    transgressed.</p>

    <p>Unexpectedly? That is too much to say. This transgression of an inferior
    law, no longer as high as man, has long been in process of preparation; but
    it came very near to being frightfully punished. Its success will be due
    only to the aid of a part of those who formerly swelled the great flood
    which today they are resisting with us, as if something in the history of
    the world or in the plans of destiny had been changed; or, rather, as if we
    had finally succeeded in changing<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_151"
    name="Page_151">[Pg 151]</a></span> something, and in bending laws to which
    we have hitherto been entirely subject.</p>

    <p>But we need not think that after victory the struggle will be ended. The
    profound forces of earth (brute force) will not lay down their arms so
    soon, and the invisible war will go on for a long time under peace. If we
    do not take care, victory will be even more fatal than defeat. In fact,
    this defeat, like its predecessors, would have been only an adjourned
    victory. It would have worn out, scattered, absorbed, the adversary by
    dispersing his energies over the world, while our victory will bring us a
    double danger. It will leave our enemies in a fierce isolation, where,
    massed upon themselves, fenced in, purified by misfortune and misery, they
    will secretly strengthen their formidable virtues, while we, no longer held
    in check by their intolerable but salutary menace, may give free rein to
    defects and vices which, soon or late, will place us at their mercy. Before
    thinking of peace, therefore, it would be well to assure ourselves of the
    future and make it powerless to harm us. We cannot take too many
    precautions when going, as we are, against the manifest desire of the power
    that is carrying us.</p>

    <p>This is why our effort is painful and meritorious. We are going, it
    cannot be too often repeated, against the law of force. Our adversaries are
    driven forward by a power that drives us back. They are advancing in the
    direction of nature, whereas we are swimming against the great current that
    flows around the globe. Earth has an idea that is no longer ours. She is
    convinced that man is an animal in all respects like other animals. She has
    not yet noticed that he has drawn away from the herd. She does not yet know
    that he has climbed her highest mountains. She has not yet heard of
    justice, of pity, of loyalty, of honor; she knows not what these are, or
    she confuses them with weakness, inefficiency, stupidity, and fear. She has
    held to the original certitudes that were indispensable in the beginnings
    of life. She is falling behind us, and the space between is growing
    rapidly. She thinks less swiftly and has yet had the time to comprehend us.
    Besides, she does not count as we do, and the ages for her are less than
    our years. She is slow because she is almost eternal, while we are swift
    because we have not many hours before us. It is possible that her thought
    may some day rejoin ours; meanwhile, we have to defend our advance and
    prove to ourselves, as we are beginning to do, that it is permitted to be
    right against her will, that our advance is not fatal, and that it is
    possible to maintain it.</p>

    <p>For it is beginning to be difficult to maintain that earth, or nature,
    or brute force, is always right, and that those who do not blindly follow
    its mandates are doomed to perish. We have learned to observe nature more
    attentively and have acquired the right to judge her. We have ascertained
    that, far from being infallible, she never ceases to deceive herself. She
    hesitates, she gropes. She does not know just what she wants. She begins
    with enormous blunders. She first peoples the world with fantastic and
    inchoate monsters, not one of which is stable, and they all disappear.
    Gradually, at the expense of the life which she creates, she acquires an
    experience which is the cruel fruit of innumerable sufferings inflicted
    with indifference. In the long run she grows wiser, learns moderation,
    corrects herself, retraces her steps, redresses her errors, and devotes to
    their reparation the best of her intelligence and of her forces. It is
    incontestable that she is perfecting her methods and that she is showing
    herself more able, more prudent, less given to excess, than in the
    beginning. It is none the less true that in all reigns, in all organisms,
    and even in our own bodies, the bad workmanship, the double uses, the
    inadvertencies, the things repented of, the absurdities, the useless
    complications, the sordid economies, and the senseless wastes continue.</p>

    <p>There is no reason, therefore, to believe that our enemies have the
    truth on their side because nature's primal force is with them. Nature does
    not possess the truth any more than we do. She searches for it as we do,
    and does not find it any more easily. She does<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_152" name="Page_152">[Pg 152]</a></span> not seem to know any more
    than we where she is going or whither she is being led by that which leads
    all things. We do not have to obey her without questioning, and there is no
    need to be disturbed or to despair if one is not of her opinion. We are not
    dealing with an infallible and immutable wisdom against which it would be
    madness to oppose one's thought. We are on the way to prove to her that she
    is in error, that the raison d'être of man is higher than that which she
    has provisionally assigned to him, that he has already surpassed her
    previsions, and that she is wrong to retard his march. Besides, she is full
    of good-will, knows how to recognize her faults on occasion, to avoid their
    disastrous consequences, and never stiffens herself in an inflexible and
    majestic self-esteem. We can convince her if we can persevere. It will take
    a great deal of time, for, I repeat, she is slow, but not at all obstinate.
    It will take a great deal of time, because it involves a very long future,
    a very great change of direction, and the most important victory for which
    man has ever hoped.</p>

    <h3>Debatable Phases of the Great Naval Conflict Reviewed by Eminent

    Mr. Thomas G. Frothingham, with a footnote and diagrams by Professor

    noted naval experts of Great Britain, and was also sent to Mr. Arthur
    Pollen, an internationally recognized naval writer in England, both of whom
    contribute comments on the American writer's article. Since his review
    appeared Mr. Frothingham has joined the National Army of the United States
    as Captain.</i>—<span class="smcap">Editor.</span></p>

    <p>There is only one thing certain in naval history, and that is that every
    great sea fight—as to the circumstances of which we have detailed
    information—has been criticised as indecisive and as not fought in the way
    which it should have been. Ex-President Theodore Roosevelt, whose fairness
    and accuracy as a naval historian have been generally recognized, has said:
    "Every historian ought to feel a sense of the most lively gratitude toward
    Nelson; in his various encounters he never left any possible room for
    dispute as to which side had come out first best." Unfortunately, this is
    going rather too far, for the merits of every one of Nelson's battles have
    been disputed, and his way of fighting each has been adversely criticised.
    This fate he shares with the great De Ruyter and with less important men.
    Rodney and Lord Howe, as commanders in general actions, were fiercely
    criticised. Lord Hawke did not receive the customary recognition of his
    services until seventeen years after the great battle of Quiberon Bay.
    Roosevelt tells us that: "In every one of De Ruyter's last six battles each
    side claimed the victory." If we had minute accounts of the talk that went
    on in the gardens and porches of ancient Athens we should, without doubt,
    learn that Salamis was far from being decisive and that, anyhow, it ought
    to have been fought in a different way. It is just as well to remember this
    whenever we are discussing a naval battle, whether of old date or recent.
    Land battles have not been treated in quite the same fashion. Their results
    have not been disputed so often, nor has the manner in which they were
    fought been so often adversely criticised.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_153" name="Page_153">[Pg
    153]</a></span>Perhaps we may account for this difference in the treatment
    of conflicts on the two elements by noting the fact that naval historians
    and critics of naval operations have but rarely been men of naval
    experience, while the historians and critics of military operations have
    usually been soldiers. There has, of course, been some conflict of opinion
    as to the results of fighting on shore, as we can see on comparing the
    communiques of the contending sides in the present war. Even after allowing
    for the unprecedented mendacity of the German authorities and the
    unprecedented gullibility of the German public there is still some sign of
    an honest difference of opinion. The difference is not due to lay or
    unprofessional ignorance.</p>

    <p>As regards naval operations in war—indeed, as regards naval affairs in
    general—it has been shown times without number that it is impossible for
    any one without naval experience to take a comprehensive or accurate view
    of naval conditions. This is by no means to disparage what shoregoing
    writers have done in naval history or in the discussion of some subjects
    largely though not totally naval. As long as they record facts they do very
    valuable work. It is when they express opinions and draw inferences from
    very technical data that they are almost certain to go astray. As a
    searcher in authoritative records and a narrator of detailed occurrences
    James is distinctly superior to Mahan; but who would give a fig for James's
    opinions? Whereas Mahan's govern the naval thought of the world.</p>

    <h3><a id="JUTLAND_RECORDS_INCOMPLETE" name=
    "JUTLAND_RECORDS_INCOMPLETE"></a>JUTLAND RECORDS INCOMPLETE</h3>

    <p>Thomas G. Frothingham's "Review of the Battle of Jutland" in
    <span class="smcap">The New York Times Current History Magazine</span> is a
    valuable account of the events of the engagement. It would not have been
    possible within the limits of his article to have related every incident,
    but he has made a judicious selection of those which he does bring forward.
    He had, of course, to depend on his sources; and on some important points
    these contained little or no information. Anything like a full account from
    the German side was virtually nonexistent. It would have been instructive
    to have put the German naval authorities into the witness box and to have
    subjected them to that species of cross-examination which consists in a
    comparison of some of their statements with others and with the statements
    of their opponents. It would be here that a writer with the true instinct
    of a historian, which Mr. Frothingham evidently does possess, could render
    valuable service had the necessary materials been at his disposal.</p>

    <p>A writer who draws inferences from data by no means full and perhaps
    open to dispute can hardly expect to carry conviction to every reader. It
    might be sufficient to deal with Mr. Frothingham's general conclusion
    concerning the battle of Jutland; but it will be well before doing so to
    notice also one or two minor but still important inferences which he draws
    from the events of the battle.</p>

    <h3><a id="GERMAN_FLEETS_OBJECT" name="GERMAN_FLEETS_OBJECT"></a>GERMAN
    FLEET'S OBJECT</h3>

    <p>Mr. Frothingham maintains that the German fleet came out with the
    object, and no other, of engaging the British fleet, a force known to be
    greatly superior in number of ships and power of ordnance. He apparently,
    but not quite clearly, suggests that the Germans knew how the British fleet
    would be employed and how it would be disposed. It would be difficult to
    put any other construction on the words—"With the object of engaging a
    fleet usually so disposed and so employed, the Germans came out from their
    bases." Surely this is a pure assumption which can only be supported by
    other assumptions founded on improbability rather than on probability.
    There is another assumption which is more plausible and which is supported
    by evidence—indirect, it is true, but copious. The war had been going on
    for more than a year and a half, and yet the German High Sea Fleet, in
    spite of its name, had sedulously refrained from venturing on the high
    seas. This made it the object of perpetual taunts by the enemies of
    Germany. There was some not completely suppressed restlessness among the
    German people.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_154" name="Page_154">[Pg
    154]</a></span>It has been an almost invariable rule in war that the fleet
    which keeps on lying in port is eventually forced to put to sea by public
    opinion. The tone and wording of many official German statements justify
    the conclusion that the German fleet put to sea with the object, not of
    meeting the British fleet, but of returning to port with the assertion that
    the British fleet had kept out of the way and that the North Sea had been
    "swept" for it in vain. Contrary to the probable expectation, Sir David
    Beatty's force was met with and there seemed a chance of being able to
    attack him with the whole strength of the German Navy. Unforeseen
    opportunities of the kind have frequently occurred in naval war, and may be
    expected frequently to occur again.</p>

    <h3><a id="FRENCH_EXPERTS_OPINION" name="FRENCH_EXPERTS_OPINION"></a>FRENCH
    EXPERT'S OPINION</h3>

    <p>Here may be quoted some observations, dated March 11, 1918, by the very
    distinguished French flag officer Vice Admiral E. F. Fournier, in a preface
    to a translation of an account of the general work of the British Navy:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>Je m'associe également aux regrets de l'auteur de cette notice
        qu'une ombre injustifiée ait été portée sur le tableau, si flatteur
        pour l'amour-propre de la Grande Bretagne, par certains critiques de la
        presse anglaise sur la bataille du Jutland. Je le fais d'autant plus
        volontiers que, dès la nouvelle de cette memorable rencontre navale,
        j'écrivis dans le Matin un article ou je vantais l'esprit de décision
        et la résolution si opportune de l'Amiral Beatty, n'hésitant pas à se
        jeter, malgré l'infériorité de ses forces, à la tête de la flotte
        allemande toute entière pour la contrecarrer dans ses desseins, en s'y
        accrochant énergiquement jusqu'a l'arrivée du renfort anglais, comme
        l'eût fait, sans aucun doute, Nelson lui-même, en pareil cas.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p class="center">TRANSLATION:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>I regret as much as does the author of this article that an
        unjustified shadow has been cast upon the picture, so flattering for
        the self-esteem of Great Britain, by certain English press criticisms
        upon the battle of Jutland. I indorse his view the more willingly
        because, on first receiving the news of that memorable naval combat, I
        wrote for the Matin an article in which I extolled Admiral Beatty's
        spirit of decision and very opportune resolution, in not hesitating to
        throw himself, despite the inferiority of his forces, at the head of
        the whole German fleet to checkmate its designs, and in hanging on
        firmly until the arrival of English reinforcements, as Nelson himself
        undoubtedly would have done in such a case.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Mr. Frothingham holds that the German fleet had not been led into a
    trap. Here, perhaps, something turns on the meaning given to particular
    words. A trap may be reasonably defined as an unforeseen and unfavorable
    position. Was it a deliberately sought or an unforeseen result that at 9 P.
    M. the German fleet was so placed that it had between it and its bases a
    hostile fleet which, as Mr. Frothingham tells us, still had an
    "overwhelming superiority in ships and guns?" Was such a position favorable
    or unfavorable? Surely there can be but one answer to each of these
    questions.</p>

    <h3><a id="LOSS_OF_BRITISH_SHIPS" name="LOSS_OF_BRITISH_SHIPS"></a>LOSS OF
    BRITISH SHIPS</h3>

    <p>Those who prefer to do so may use long words like "psychology" and
    "mentality," but the plain English of the situation is that the public mind
    in the allied and neutral countries was greatly impressed by the news that
    the British fleet had lost several ships, and by the fact that these losses
    were announced in the earlier part of the official communiqué concerning
    the battle. In the few great sea fights of which anything was generally
    remembered, the British had not lost ships. This, however, was far from
    being the universal rule.</p>

    <p>In the great naval actions of the seventeenth century we lost many
    ships. It was recognized that a fleet might be victorious and still lose
    ships. The great Lord Hawke at Quiberon Bay lost ships. The contending
    fleets of the present day are so very large that they recall those of the
    seventeenth and early eighteenth centuries, when ships were lost in action
    by both sides. This, especially in view of the power of the naval ordnance
    of today, is almost certain to occur again. There is a wide difference
    between the naval gun of the present day and that of Nelson's and earlier
    times. The primary object of the older gun was to cause casualties among
    the enemy's crews; the modern naval gun is meant to<span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_155" name="Page_155">[Pg 155]</a></span> destroy his
    ships. A fifteen-inch gun is not necessary to kill or wound a man. Naval
    weapons would be complete failures if, in sea fights, they were to prove
    incapable of destroying ships, and there is no probability that the
    destruction will fall on one side only.</p>

    <p>Mr. Frothingham's final conclusion is that the "actual tactical result
    of the battle was indecisive." A very full definition of an indecisive
    tactical result would be instructive. One result of the battle of Jutland
    is beyond dispute and is in no way a matter of opinion. These lines are
    being written on the 12th of May, 1918, close upon two years after the
    battle of Jutland was fought. Not once during all that long time has the
    German High Sea Fleet ventured on the high seas or done more than just peep
    over the edge of its sheltering mine fields.</p>

    <h2><a id="Comment_by_Mr_Arthur_Pollen" name=
    "Comment_by_Mr_Arthur_Pollen"></a>Comment by Mr. Arthur Pollen</h2>

    <p><i>Arthur Pollen, the English naval critic, offers the following
    observations on debatable phases of the battle</i>:</p>

    <p>I have read Mr. Frothingham's article, and it seems to me to be
    substantially accurate as a synopsis of the officially published events of
    the afternoon and evening. The writer's comments also seem to be judicious
    and fair. The battle raises, however, so many and such large problems,
    strategical, tactical, and technical, that it is impossible for any writer
    to exhaust the matter, or even to indicate the disputable points in so
    small a space as Mr. Frothingham has been able to devote to it.</p>

    <p>In one or two not unimportant particulars I hold a different view of the
    facts and different opinions from the writer. For example, it seems to me
    that the Grand Fleet did not, as Mr. Frothingham states on Page 339, at
    6:25 form in battle line astern of the battle cruisers. The plan published
    with the dispatches makes it seem more probable that the van of the Grand
    Fleet followed a course considerably to the north though parallel to that
    of the battle cruisers, and that it was not until about 7:05 that they
    turned from an easterly to a southerly course and formed astern of the Vice
    Admiral commanding the battle cruiser fleet. The story of the action might
    have been very different had circumstances permitted of the Grand Fleet
    going into action astern of the Vice Admiral at 6:15.</p>

    <p>Again, Page 337, I cannot agree that it is evident that the German fleet
    was not forced into action with the Grand Fleet, but that Vice Admiral
    Scheer deliberately chose to engage that force. There is nothing to show
    that Scheer suspected Jellicoe was on the scene until he began to turn from
    north to southeast about a quarter of an hour before the Grand Fleet was
    sighted.</p>

    <p>Again, Page 339, I cannot agree that it was the night disposition of the
    fleet that was the crucial decision. It is true it ended the battle for the
    night, but the decision which gave the battle its character was taken
    earlier in the day, when the enemy was allowed to open the range under the
    cover of destroyer attacks and smoke screens. In the existing atmospheric
    conditions and light it was impossible for gunnery to be effective, even at
    12,000 and 9,000 yards and the only terms on which the German fleet could
    be defeated and sunk would have been those of close action. The refusal of
    close action was due to the menace of the German destroyer attacks, used on
    this occasion for purposes of defense and to afford an opportunity of
    evasion, with masterly skill and decisive effect. The dispositions and
    tactics of the night action are a different matter, but of these we are
    still completely ignorant.</p>

    <p class="center">By CAPTAIN VON KUEHLWETTER</p>

    <p class="center" style="font-style: italic">of the German Imperial
    Navy</p>

    <p class="center">[This article on the battle of Jutland was written during
    the<br />
    week following the day on which it was fought, May 31, 1916]</p>

    <p>Although Trafalgar, Tsushima, and Skagerrak will be treated and
    discussed together in future naval histories, it is not yet possible to
    draw the full historical consequences from the two last-named naval
    battles. We can estimate the effects of Trafalgar on the history of the
    world, for we know that it laid the foundations of British naval supremacy.
    With the exception of the immediate military advantage gained, the full
    results of the battle of Tsushima have not yet been developed. Still less
    can the battle of Skagerrak have left its impress upon world history.</p>

    <p>For us Skagerrak [Jutland] has been a great, decisive victory, which our
    whole High Sea Fleet gained after a long, bitterly contested battle on the
    open sea, far from the home coast and its points of support, against the
    superior British Grand Fleet. Our naval forces inflicted upon the British
    fleet losses which, in terms of tons, even according to the British
    Admiralty, were double ours. But the tonnage does not fully represent the
    seriousness of the losses, since the British lost three dreadnoughts, as
    against one of ours, and three armored cruisers, as against one of our old
    armored cruisers.</p>

    <p>If we add to this what our own observations, supported by statements of
    British prisoners, show, the enemy's losses were three and a half times
    ours; that is, in terms of fighting units, six dreadnoughts, including two
    older types, as against one dreadnought and one pre-dreadnought, and four
    armored cruisers and one small cruiser, as against four small cruisers.</p>

    <p>The purpose of a battle is destruction, the victor being the side which
    goes further in this direction. The figures just quoted can leave no doubt
    on this point.</p>

    <p>The German fleet remained on the battle area. After the repeatedly
    successful attacks of our torpedo boat flotillas the British fleet was
    forced to sheer off, and we never saw it again. Although the British ships
    were superior in speed and were reinforced by the arrival of twelve
    additional battleships, they made no attempt to recover contact with us and
    continue the battle. Our numerous torpedo boats searched for the British
    fleet all night without finding it, and instead utilized the opportunity to
    rescue a large number of British sailors.</p>

    <p>This justifies us in calling the battle an absolute victory for us. It
    has demonstrated that the German fleet had within it the power to beat the
    more numerous and more up-to-date British fleet, and it opens up great
    possibilities for the future.</p>

    <p>The battle of Skagerrak did not decide the war. Neither did Trafalgar
    nor Tsushima, nor did Tannenburg or the battle of the Masurian Lakes. A
    single battle between great powers will never be ultimately decisive. How
    much it contributes to the final outcome of a war cannot be estimated. The
    greatest result so far is not in the fact that Great Britain lost ships,
    but in the victory.</p>

    <h3><a id="TRAFALGAR_AND_JUTLAND" name=
    "TRAFALGAR_AND_JUTLAND"></a>TRAFALGAR AND JUTLAND</h3>

    <p>Trafalgar and the name of Nelson stand high in naval history. Let us
    draw a military comparison between Trafalgar and the battle of Skagerrak.
    At Trafalgar there were on the British side 27 ships of the line, (of which
    8 had 80 guns, 16 had 74 guns, and 3 had 64 guns,) four frigates, and two
    smaller vessels. On the side of the allied French and Spanish fleet there
    were 33 ships of the line, (of which 10 had from 80 to 110 guns, 22 had 74
    guns, and one had 64 guns,) three frigates, and two smaller vessels. The
    French and Spanish<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_157" name=
    "Page_157">[Pg 157]</a></span> fleet was not only numerically stronger, but
    its ships were better built and better armed.</p>

    <div class="figcenter" style="width: 459px;">
        <a id="A_GERMAN_DIAGRAM_OF_THE_BATTLE_OF_THE_SKAGERRAK_JUTLAND" name=
        "A_GERMAN_DIAGRAM_OF_THE_BATTLE_OF_THE_SKAGERRAK_JUTLAND"></a>

        <div class="caption">
            A GERMAN DIAGRAM OF THE BATTLE OF THE SKAGERRAK (JUTLAND)
        </div>
    </div>

    <p>In the battle of Skagerrak we had opposing each other: On the British
    side, thirty-one dreadnoughts, inclusive of six battle cruisers, and four
    armored cruisers; on the German side, twenty-one dreadnoughts, inclusive of
    five battle cruisers, and six older cruisers. Roughly speaking, we had
    twenty-seven big ships against thirty-live. Here also the better quality,
    judged by size, up-to-dateness, and armament, was on the side of the larger
    fleet. Apart from these big ships, there were on each side about fifty
    smaller vessels.</p>

    <p>The total tonnage of the British fleet at Trafalgar was equal to about
    two modern dreadnoughts, as one of the ships of the line in Nelson's time
    was of about 2,000 tons. In numbers of guns and of crew there were more at
    Trafalgar, as at that time the ships were sailing vessels.</p>

    <p>The British had between 17,000 and 20,000 men engaged, against 21,000 to
    24,000. At Skagerrak we had from 35,000 to 40,000, as against 45,000 to
    50,000 men. In this way we can compare the battle in its general aspect
    with Trafalgar. But if we look into the matter more closely, the French and
    Spanish fleet had within it an element of weakness arising from the fact
    that it consisted of two allied forces, between which there is never
    complete co-ordination. The French were further weakened by effects of the
    Revolution and exhaustion from previous battles. The French Admiral himself
    said: "Never before was the French fleet at such a low standard. We had bad
    masts, bad sails, bad rigging, bad officers, and bad seamen." Of the
    Spanish, Nelson said: "They have neither seamen nor officers." At the head
    of the allied forces was a French Admiral who had no confidence in the
    fleet and who was acting under instructions issued by Napoleon, which he
    felt incapable of carrying out. Opposed to him was the seasoned and
    well-schooled fleet of Nelson, so that it was not a battle of equal
    opponents and the result was annihilation. None of the French or Spanish
    ships was again seen at sea; nineteen were captured or destroyed, ten were
    driven into harbor and blockaded; four escaped, only to fall into the hands
    of the victors a few days later.</p>

    <h3><a id="COMPARED_WITH_TSUSHIMA" name=
    "COMPARED_WITH_TSUSHIMA"></a>COMPARED WITH TSUSHIMA</h3>

    <p>And now Tsushima, another parallel. A Russian fleet, made up of any old
    vessels the Russians could get together, and of what ships still remained
    in the East—supported by Port Arthur—made one last bid against the sea
    power of the enemy. Without training, without points of support,
    honeycombed with revolutionary ideas, the Russian fleet started<span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_158" name="Page_158">[Pg 158]</a></span> on its trip
    to the Far East, where it arrived on May 27, after suffering terrible
    hardships and being more than six months on the way to meet the enemy.
    Meanwhile, Port Arthur, with its fleet, had fallen. The Russian Admiral
    knew that he had absolutely no chance, but he did not have enough courage
    to retreat. Blindly and without confidence he started the battle against an
    opponent who was superior in numbers, equipment, and training. Of the 38
    Russian ships which arrived on the morning of May 27, 1905, in the Strait
    of Korea, 19 were sunk and 7 captured, including 2 hospital ships. The
    Russian Admiral, 273 officers, and 5,833 petty officers and men were taken
    prisoner; 201 officers and 4,344 men were killed. Against this the Japanese
    lost only three torpedo boats and about 700 men.</p>

    <p>Trafalgar was not a battle between equal forces, and still less so was
    Tsushima; hence, as regards their military value, they cannot be compared
    with Skagerrak. In this battle for the first time there were two sides
    equally well trained, equally imbued with the same spirit, equally
    determined. Here also the smaller force won. The superior force had to quit
    the battle area, and only the power it retained within itself saved it from
    annihilation. This battle gave us, in the military sense, a victory such as
    naval history has never yet recorded. Its moral effect upon our fleet,
    especially after the long harassing wait, cannot be expressed in words. It
    did not end the war, but it gave us more confidence and startled England,
    who always thought she had an invincible fleet.</p>

    <p>On the victory of Trafalgar England founded her colonial world power,
    because she thereby obtained the mastery of the seas, which remained
    unchallenged. Tsushima gave Japan the sea power in the East which she
    needed to carry out her military plans on land. It no more ended the
    Japanese-Russian war than Trafalgar had ended the struggle of that day, but
    it gave Japan a military success which was of great value to her in peace
    negotiations. We hope that Skagerrak is a blow against the victory of
    Trafalgar and the first step toward the smashing of British sea power, and
    that other mighty hammer blows will fall against the barriers which shut
    off other peoples from the freedom of the seas.</p>

        <p>A special mission, consisting of Stuart, Bunning, (England,) Jouhaux
        and Cachin, (France,) a Belgian delegate, an Italian delegate, and the
        Secretary of the International Socialist Bureau, Camille Huysmans, has
        gone to the United States in order to obtain the adhesion of the
        American working class to this memorandum, which expresses the point of
        <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_159" name="Page_159">[Pg
        159]</a></span>view of the organized proletariat of the Entente
        countries with regard to the necessary foundations of a democratic
        peace and the principal conditions for a general international Labor
        and Socialist conference, which has been summoned to a neutral country
        by "a committee which provides all guarantees of impartiality toward
        the various elements which are called to take part."</p>

        <p>In making this communication to you the signatories of this message
        consider it profitable to recall objectively the reasons which
        determined the acceptance of the procedure proposed by the London
        Conference.</p>

        <p>The conference was of the opinion that it would be of no use to
        assemble a general congress unless its aim had been established in
        principle.</p>

        <p>The conference was of the opinion that "the principal condition for
        the holding of a plenary assembly of the International consists in its
        organizers satisfying themselves that all the organizations to be
        represented formulate in precise terms and by a public declaration
        their peace conditions upon the basis of the principles of peace
        without annexations and without indemnities of a punitive character,
        and the right of the peoples to self-determination," and, further, that
        these organizations will "work with all their power to obtain from
        their Governments the necessary guarantee that these principles shall
        be applied honestly and without <i>arriere-pensées</i> in the
        settlement of all questions raised at the official peace
        conference."</p>

        <p>In order itself to satisfy these conditions, the London Conference
        has considered it necessary to state precisely its views and its action
        in the memorandum which we are commissioned to communicate to you.</p>

        <p>The conference expects that your party, following the same idea,
        will resolve to issue a public declaration of a similar kind, whether
        separately or jointly with the Labor and Socialist organizations of
        Central Europe.</p>

        <p>In the opinion of those who took part in the London Conference the
        comparison of these documents will be of the greatest importance. It
        will be a principal means of establishing whether a sufficient
        agreement of views exists between the proletariats of the two
        belligerent groups to make possible a common action against imperialism
        and for a democratic peace. This preliminary examination is all the
        more necessary, because it is obvious that no important party,
        conscious of its responsibility, will run the risk of having the
        resolutions of an international congress imposed upon it by the will of
        a majority. Only resolutions which were the expression of a general and
        common will would possess moral authority and practical effect.</p>

        <p>The sum of the matter is that the Socialists of the Entente
        countries request you in this grave hour, in which it is necessary to
        know whether the world is to be freed by democracy or to be handed over
        to imperialism, to ask your consciences whether a real, sincere, and
        effective agreement of the wills of the proletariats is possible in
        order to put an end to the law of violence, in order to lay the
        foundations not of a peace, but of the peace, and in order to help the
        peoples to liberate themselves from the endless chain of military war
        which leads to economic wars, and of economic wars which will again
        produce military wars.</p>

        <p>We add to the messages only one observation. Since the London
        Conference momentous events have taken place which constitute the
        gravest menace for the workers of all countries. The principles to
        which they appeal have been shamefully violated. The right of the
        peoples to self-determination has been openly disregarded. In Austria
        and Germany themselves Socialists have expressed the fear that Russia,
        disarmed and for the moment impotent, might become a battleground in
        which the rival imperialisms and their claims would meet and ultimately
        satisfy themselves jointly at the cost of the defeated revolution.</p>

        <p>The working classes have a common interest in protesting against
        such events and in preventing the realization of such projects.</p>

        <p>That is the wish of the authors and the signatories of the
        memorandum. In the same spirit we beg you to subject this document to a
        conscientious and thorough examination.</p>

        <p>In communicating this request to you we address to you, comrades,
        our Socialist greetings.</p>

    <p>At a meeting of the Socialist Party Committee in Berlin on May 31,
    according to the Vorwärts, Friedrich Ebert, Vice President of the Social
    Democrats, announced that the party leaders had indirectly received a copy
    of the Entente Socialist memorandum on war aims. Philipp Scheidemann
    declared that the aims of the Entente Socialists were to a great extent in
    complete accord with the annexationist aims of the Entente Governments. The
    committee adopted a resolution pledging continued adherence to the
    Reichstag peace resolution of July, 1917, which declared for no annexations
    and no indemnities.</p>

    <h2><a id="Trade_After_the_War" name="Trade_After_the_War"></a>Trade After
    the War</h2>

    <p>The State Department at Washington announced on June 5, 1918, that it
    had appointed an economic representative, who was to join the American
    Embassy at Rome. This was regarded as the first step in a general policy of
    more active participation by the United States in preparations of the
    nations at war with Germany for the after-the-war trade struggle.</p>

    <p>The new treaty of alliance between Germany and Austria to control all
    Central European sources of raw materials, and to exclude other nations
    from equal trade privileges, with similar restrictions imposed by the new
    treaties forced on Finland, Ukrainia, and Rumania, changed the attitude of
    the American Government, which at first had not assented to the proposals
    of the Paris Economic Conference to interpose artificial obstructions to
    free commerce with the Central Powers after the war.</p>

    <p>The Italian Government recently named a commission to study
    after-the-war problems, and with this commission the American economic
    delegate will have close relations. Italian importing and exporting
    interests in the United States also have taken advantage of the opportunity
    afforded by the decision of the Italian Government to consider this
    important subject, and have joined in the dispatch of a committee to Italy
    to co-operate. Italian industries, though of great potential strength and
    capable of returning large profits on their capitalization, are said to
    require substantial assistance from America if they are to go on after the
    war without relapsing into the control of German financiers.</p>

    <p>It is reported that economic representatives will be sent to the
    American Embassies in all the allied capitals.</p>

    <p>On May 14 Mr. Bonar Law, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, announced
    in the House of Commons that, in order to leave its country's hands free
    for the time when peace arrived, the French Government had denounced all
    commercial conventions containing a general clause regarding "most-favored
    nations"; and that, in view of the probable scarcity of raw material after
    the war and the necessity for providing for the needs of the British Empire
    and the Allies, the British Government intended to adopt a similar
    course.</p>

    <p>In answer to other questions, Mr. Bonar Law said that the British
    Government had not changed its policy expressed in the Paris resolutions
    since the entrance of the United States into the war; he had every reason
    to believe that America was very anxious for unity of economic control, and
    agreed that any useful action would be much more effective if taken in
    conjunction with our allies.</p>

    <p>Lord Balfour of Burleigh's committee considered the question of the
    denunciation of commercial treaties and reported against it. The report
    contains a summary of the various commercial treaties which are in
    existence between Great Britain and other countries. Those with enemy
    countries have been terminated by the war. In the case of allied countries
    commercial treaties on the basis of reciprocal most-favored-nation
    treatment are in force between the United Kingdom and Italy, Portugal,
    Russia, the United States, Japan, Serbia, and Montenegro. There is a
    similar treaty with Rumania. United Kingdom goods have most-favored-nation
    treatment in France, owing to a legislative enactment and not by treaty
    right, for customs duties were excepted from the scope of the Anglo-French
    commercial convention of 1882.</p>

    <p>Great Britain has commercial treaties on the most-favored-nation basis
    with Switzerland and Greece. In the case of the Netherlands and Denmark,
    the general principle of most-favored-nation treatment is subject to minor
    limitations. The position with regard to Sweden and Norway is doubtful; but
    the old treaty of 1826 with Sweden and Norway on a reciprocal
    most-favored-nation basis has continued in operation in practice, in spite
    of the dissolution of the union between Sweden and Norway in 1905.</p>

    <p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_161" name="Page_161">[Pg
    161]</a></span></p>

    <p>Outside Europe, Great Britain has commercial treaties providing for
    reciprocal and unconditional most-favored-nation treatment with Argentina,
    Bolivia, Colombia, Honduras, Mexico, Nicaragua, Paraguay, and Venezuela.
    Those with Costa Rica and Liberia are conditional.</p>

    <p>Nearly all these commercial treaties are subject to a fixed period of
    notice on either side as a condition of denunciation. The treaty with Japan
    cannot be terminated before 1923. The treaty with Portugal has only
    recently been completed, after years of negotiation. Twelve months' notice
    of termination is required in the case of the treaty with Switzerland and
    of most of those with neutral countries outside Europe. The Spanish
    agreement—it is based on an exchange of notes in 1894—is subject to six
    months' notice.</p>

    <p>Before the war there was no commercial treaty between the United Kingdom
    and Germany. The United Kingdom enjoyed most-favored-nation treatment in
    Germany in customs matters by virtue of a biennial law.</p>

    "Exchange_of_Naval_Greetings_With_England"></a>Exchange of Naval Greetings
    With England</h2>

    <p>The following exchange of greetings between the heads of the navies of
    the United States and Great Britain was made public:</p>

    <p class="right"><i>Washington, April 5, 1918.</i><br /></p>

    <blockquote>
        <p><span class="smcap">My Dear Sir</span>: Your references to the
        splendid spirit of co-operation between the navies of our two
        countries, and your warm praise of the officers and men of the navy who
        have gone abroad, have been most grateful to me and to the men in the
        navy and to all Americans. The brightest spot in the tragedy of this
        war is this mutual appreciation of the men in the naval service. Our
        officers who have returned confirm the statements of Vice Admiral Sims
        of the courtesies and kindness shown in every way by the Admiralty and
        officers of the British fleet, and we have reciprocated by receiving
        cordially the able and efficient officers who have come from your
        country to confer and work elbow to elbow with our officers in the
        difficult work which this war imposes upon the naval service of all the
        countries allied in the war against the submarine menace.</p>

        <p>I had hoped to have the pleasure of visiting Great Britain and
        personally expressing this feeling of mutual working together and of
        exchanging views, but the task here of making ready more and more units
        for the fleet is a very serious one, and my duty chains me here. The
        order in all the navy is "full speed ahead" in the construction of
        destroyers and other craft, and the whole service is keyed up to press
        this programme forward as rapidly as possible. Therefore I shall not
        have the pleasure until this program shall materialize better and
        better of personal acquaintance and conference, which would be of such
        interest and value.</p>

        the public reference which I have made to the very cordial relations

    <p class="center">Prince Lichnowsky's Memorandum a Document of Vital
    Importance to History</p>

    <p class="center">By VISCOUNT BRYCE</p>

    <p class="center" style="font-style: italic">Former British Ambassador to
    the United States</p>

    <p class="center">[Copyright, 1918, by The New York Times Company]</p>

    <p>The secret memorandum which Prince Lichnowsky wrote as a record and
    vindication of his conduct while German Ambassador in England is the most
    important single document which has come before the world since the first
    days of the war. It was not meant to become known during the war, perhaps
    not within his own lifetime. It was written not to justify England but to
    criticise the policy which tied Germany to Austria, and was published
    without, and indeed against, its author's will. It may have been composed
    partly to relieve the writer's own feelings, from an impulse which those
    will understand who are prevented by considerations of public duty from
    vindicating their conduct to the world. It may also be due to the sense,
    natural to men who have borne a part in great events, that they owe it to
    posterity to contribute what they can to the truth of history. Anyhow, it
    has exposed him to the anger and persecution of the German Government; and
    this persecution is evidence of the importance it attaches to it as a
    condemnation of its conduct. The truth of its contents has been confirmed,
    if indeed it needed confirmation, by the statements of Herr von Jagow, late
    German Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs, and of Herr Mühlon, one of
    the Krupp directors.</p>

    <p>Prince Lichnowsky appears in this document as a man of clear vision and
    cool judgment, an acute observer of social as well as political phenomena,
    a good witness both to what he noted during his residence here and to what
    he knew of the action of his own Government. And now let us see what he
    records.</p>

    <p>When the war began in August, 1914, the German Government entered on two
    campaigns, which it has ever since prosecuted with equal energy and an
    equal disregard of honor and humanity.</p>

    <p>One of these was the campaign by arms. It suddenly invaded Belgium, a
    peaceful neutral country, whose neutrality it was pledged to respect, and
    which it has treated with the utmost cruelty, murdering, or reducing to the
    slavery of forced labor, its civilian and noncombatant inhabitants. It has
    similarly enslaved the inhabitants of Poland, and has encouraged its
    Turkish allies to massacre their innocent Armenian subjects.</p>

    <h3><a id="A_CAMPAIGN_OF_FALSEHOOD" name="A_CAMPAIGN_OF_FALSEHOOD"></a>A
    CAMPAIGN OF FALSEHOOD</h3>

    <p>The other campaign was one of falsehood, conducted by speeches and
    through the press, and intended to mislead public opinion. It was an effort
    to deceive both its own people and neutral nations by mendacious
    misrepresentations of German aims, purposes, and conduct, and by equally
    false descriptions of the aims, purposes, and conduct of Germany's
    antagonists, and especially of the British Government and the British
    people. It tried to represent the war as having been forced upon Germany by
    Britain. Germany, it said, was merely defending herself against an
    unprovoked attack. She desired to live at peace with her neighbors,
    developing her own resources, cherishing no aggressive designs. Her
    enormous army and navy had been created only to protect her against the
    jealous and malicious enemies by whom she was surrounded, and especially
    against Great Britain. Britain, it seems, was envious of Germany. Being
    herself "a decadent nation"—this was the prevailing German<span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_163" name="Page_163">[Pg 163]</a></span> view—she
    feared the commercial competition of Germany, and tried to keep the latter
    out of all foreign markets. British policy—so they said—under the direction
    of King Edward VII., had formed alliances with France and Russia in order
    to hem in Germany, and after trying to block Germany's outlets in Africa
    and Asia, contrived this war to destroy by arms the rival whom she could
    not face up to in trade and manufacturing industry.</p>

    <p>While these accusations were brought against Britain, attempts were made
    to excuse the invasion of Belgium by the false stories, dropped as soon as
    they had served their temporary purpose, that French officers had been sent
    into Belgium to help to organize the Belgian troops against Germany and
    that French aviators had been flying over German territory.</p>

    <p>Grotesque as all these inventions were, they were repeated with such
    audacity as to produce some effect in neutral countries. But their chief
    and more lasting influence was on the German people. A large part of the
    German press, inspired and controlled by the German Government, had for
    some time past been holding up England as the persistent foe of Germany. It
    now redoubled its falsehoods, representing Sir Edward Grey as having
    plotted to bring about a war, and urged Russia to refuse a peaceful
    solution; and it added equally groundless charges that England had secretly
    planned with Belgium to attack Germany through Belgian territory. These
    fables, repeated incessantly by German politicians, as well as by the
    newspapers, found ready credence with the German people, easily led by
    their press, always docile to the orders of their Government, and now swept
    off their feet by a wave of patriotism and by the belief that they were
    about to achieve a victory as rapid and complete as that of 1870. It was
    this conviction of the malevolence and the grasping ambition of England
    that created that ferocious hatred of the English which has continued to
    display itself in the treatment of English prisoners and in the exultation
    over such crimes as the sinking of the Lusitania.</p>

    <h3><a id="ORGANIZED_HATE" name="ORGANIZED_HATE"></a>ORGANIZED HATE</h3>

    <p>This sudden outburst of hatred in a nation so intelligent startled and
    amazed us. It can be understood only when we remember that the German
    Government did everything in its power not only to create hatred, but also
    to stifle every voice that was raised to let the people know the truth.
    They never have been permitted to know the truth, and the disappointment
    that fell upon them when their march on Paris was arrested with the help of
    a British Army and their coasts strictly blockaded by a British fleet added
    fuel to their anger and has made it ever since an easier matter to keep the
    truth from them.</p>

    <p>Now, what was the truth?</p>

    <p>The British people bore no hatred whatever toward the German people.
    King Edward VII. meant no harm to Germany when he showed his liking for the
    French. Neither did his Ministers when they took steps to remove the
    differences that had been causing trouble between ourselves and France, and
    again when they came to a friendly understanding with Russia. These
    arrangements were made in the interests of European peace and good-will,
    not in order to damage Germany. British merchants and manufacturers never
    dreamed of fighting Germany to get rid of her commercial competition. Had
    such an idea occurred to them, they would have reflected that Germany was
    England's best foreign customer, not to add that two years of even a
    successful war would have inflicted far more loss upon them than the
    extension of German trade competition could have repaired in twenty years.
    British men of science and learning admired the immense contributions
    Germany had been making to the progress of knowledge, and they had many
    personal friends in Germany. British statesmen did not desire to add to
    British possessions abroad, feeling that we had already all we needed, and
    that the greatest interest of the British Empire was a universal peace.</p>

    <p>No section of our people, neither traders, nor thinkers and writers, nor
    statesmen, had any idea of the dangers to<span class="pagenum"><a id=
    "Page_164" name="Page_164">[Pg 164]</a></span> the mind and the purpose of
    those who ruled Germany. We did not realize what the feudal aristocracy and
    military caste of Germany were pondering and planning, nor how little
    weight they attached to considerations either of good faith or of humanity.
    Hence, beyond maintaining a strong fleet, the indispensable protection of a
    country open to sea attack which did not maintain a large army, we had made
    no preparations for war, and had scarcely bethought ourselves of what
    action we should have to take on land if we became involved in war. In this
    belief and attitude there may have been less prudence than was needed. But
    our absence of suspicion is the best proof of how little we expected
    aggression. It is an absolute refutation of the calumny that Britain, with
    her tiny army, was planning an attack on the greatest military power in the
    world.</p>

    <p>All this every Englishman knows. I repeat it only because it has now
    received not only a confirmation but also a valuable further proof in the
    Lichnowsky memorandum, a proof unsolicited and uncontemplated, and,
    moreover, unimpeachable, because it comes from one who bore a leading part
    in what it records, and who never meant to let it become known.</p>

    <h3><a id="ENGLANDS_PACIFIC_SPIRIT" name=
    "ENGLANDS_PACIFIC_SPIRIT"></a>ENGLAND'S PACIFIC SPIRIT</h3>

    <p>First—The memorandum bears witness to the pacific spirit of the British
    people. Here are some of its words:</p>

    <p>"The commercial jealousy about which we [in Germany] hear so much is
    based on a wrong conception of the circumstances. Certainly Germany's rise
    as a commercial power after 1870 and during the following decades was a
    menace to British commercial circles which with their industries and export
    houses had held a virtual monopoly. The increasing commerce with Germany,
    which was the leading country in Europe as regards British exports, had,
    however, given rise to the wish to maintain friendly relations with their
    best customer and business friend, and had driven all other considerations
    into the background. Notably, in commercial spirit and the effort to
    further our common commercial interests.</p>

    <p>"At the English cities to which I was invited (by the Chambers of
    Commerce and municipalities) I was well received everywhere. * * * In all
    other circles I also met with the most friendly reception and
    co-operation—at Court, in society, and from the Government.</p>

    <p>"On account of our fleet alone England would not have drawn the sword
    any more than on account of our trade, which has been alleged to have
    produced jealousy and finally war. * * * It was possible to arrive at an
    understanding in spite of the fleet, and without a 'naval holiday,'
    [intermission of naval shipbuilding.]"</p>

    <p>Second—The memorandum shows that the attitude of the British Government,
    and in particular of Sir Edward Grey, then Foreign Minister, was entirely
    pacific. The admirable characterization of Sir Edward it contains is too
    long to quote, but it testifies to his perfect straightforwardness and
    constant wish to maintain good relations with Germany, and after describing
    how "the simplicity and honesty of his ways secured him the respect even of
    his opponents," it adds: "This is a true picture of the man who is decried
    [in Germany] as 'Liar Grey' and instigator of the world war."</p>

    <p>The memorandum goes on to show how sincerely Sir Edward had worked for
    peace, first in 1913, during the Balkan troubles, when he went hand-in-hand
    with Germany, "hardly ever supporting the French or Russian claims. He
    conducted the negotiations with circumspection, calm, and tact."
    Frequently, when appealed to by Lichnowsky to use his influence with the
    Russian Government to arrange difficulties between it and Germany, "Sir
    Edward gladly did this, and his intervention contributed in no small degree
    to smooth the matter over."</p>

    <p>Third—A still weightier evidence of the good-will of the British
    Government is supplied by the account given of the concessions made to
    German wishes in Asia and Africa. "Sir Edward Grey," says the memorandum,
    "after having<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_165" name="Page_165">[Pg
    165]</a></span> outstanding points of difference with France and Russia,
    wished to make similar agreements with us. It was not his object to isolate
    us, but to the best of his power to make us partners in the existing
    association. As he had succeeded in overcoming Anglo-French and
    Anglo-Russian differences, so he also wished to do his best to eliminate
    the Anglo-German, and, by a network of treaties, which would no doubt have
    led in the end to an agreement on the troublesome question of naval
    armaments, to insure the peace of the world.</p>

    <h3><a id="THE_BAGDAD_RAILWAY" name="THE_BAGDAD_RAILWAY"></a>THE BAGDAD
    RAILWAY</h3>

    <p>"His plan was, in his own words, without interfering with England's
    existing friendship, which had no aggressive aims and does not entail any
    binding obligations, to arrive at a friendly rapprochement and
    understanding with Germany to bring the two groups [of powers] nearer." In
    pursuance of this policy, the British Government went a very long way to
    meet German wishes in respect to the Bagdad Railway. They agreed to let it
    be prolonged to El Basra; they included the whole of Mesopotamia as far as
    that town in the German sphere of influence, and also the whole district of
    the Bagdad and Anatolian railway, i. e., all the centre of Asia Minor.</p>

    <p>Not less large were the concessions made in South Central Africa. "The
    new agreement [regarding the interests of Germany and England in the
    African possessions of Portugal] was fully in accord with German wishes and
    interests. For these the British Government showed the greatest
    consideration. Sir E. Grey intended to demonstrate his good-will toward us,
    but he also wished to assist our colonial development as a whole." These
    arrangements were embodied in two treaties highly advantageous to Germany,
    which, however, the German Government, for some reasons of its own, had
    postponed signing, so that they remained unpublished up till the outbreak
    of the war. Had we in the inner spirit of the German Government, and the
    use it would make of our concessions, British Ministers might well have
    hesitated to go so far as they did. But that they conceded so much is the
    completest proof of their good-will and the most convincing refutation of
    the charges which the German Ministers and press have brought against
    them.</p>

    <p>It would take too long to follow out in this article the constant
    efforts of the British Government during the fateful days before the
    outbreak of the war to avoid a conflict by means of Sir E. Grey's repeated
    plans of mediation and adjustment. The memorandum shows how earnestly he
    labored for peace at Berlin, at Petersburg, at Vienna, and how all his
    attempts were baffled by the settled purpose of the German Government to
    force on war.</p>

    <h3><a id="THE_POTSDAM_CONFERENCE" name="THE_POTSDAM_CONFERENCE"></a>THE
    POTSDAM CONFERENCE</h3>

    <p>Britain may, like other nations, have in the past sometimes indulged her
    ambition, sometimes abused her strength, sometimes embarked in wars that
    might well have been avoided. But on this occasion at least she is
    blameless. Never in her long history has she had so perfectly clear a
    conscience as in the case of this war. Her people neither contemplated it
    nor desired it. They were driven into it by the action of the German
    Government, which persisted in pushing it on even when Austria seemed
    willing to draw back. All had evidently been settled at that famous Potsdam
    conference, when (as the German Ambassador at Constantinople, before Italy
    had declared war against Austria, told his Italian colleague) the Emperor
    had inquired of his military and naval chiefs whether they were ready for
    the conflict for which, during some months preceding, preparations had been
    in progress. Neither when the war began did Britain wish to do more than
    prevent Germany from destroying Belgium and mortally wounding France. Sir
    E. Grey spoke truly for the nation when, as the memorandum records, he
    said: "We don't want to crush Germany."</p>

    <h3>Lord Haldane's Official Report of His Conciliatory Mission Prior to the
    War</h3>

    <p><i>Lord Haldane, the British Minister for War in 1912, was sent on a
    mission to Berlin in that year to confer with the German Chancellor, Dr.
    von Bethmann Hollweg, in the hope of reaching some agreement with Germany
    for a mutual reduction of armament, and for the establishment of conditions
    that would preserve European peace. The hope regarding armaments was not
    fulfilled, and the conversations that had taken place were not made public
    by either Government; but late in May, 1918, in view of the revelations of
    Prince Lichnowsky regarding Germany's responsibility for the war, the
    British Government at length published Lord Haldane's report. It is in the
    form of a daily record, beginning Feb. 8, 1912, and is here reproduced in
    full, with the exception of parts relating solely to British defensive
    measures</i>:</p>

    <p>At the interview with the Chancellor, which took place at 2 o'clock and
    lasted for more than an hour and a half, I began by giving him the message
    of good wishes for the conversations and for the future of Anglo-German
    relations with which the King had intrusted me at the audience I had before
    leaving. He was pleased with this message, and intimated that he would
    write through the German Ambassador to thank the King. I then said that
    perhaps it would be convenient if I defined the capacity in which I was in
    Berlin, and there to talk to him; and I defined it as above intimated. I
    proceeded to ask whether he wished to make any observations or desired that
    I should begin. He wished me to begin, and I went on at once to speak to
    him as arranged in a conversation I had had with Sir Edward Grey before
    leaving London.</p>

    <p>"At the interview with the Chancellor, which took place at 2 o'clock and

    I should begin. He wished me to begin, and I went on at once to speak to
    him as arranged in a conversation I had had with Sir Edward Grey before
    leaving London."</p>

    <p>"I told him that I felt there had been a great deal of drifting away
    between Germany and England, and that it was important to ask what was the
    cause. To ascertain this, events of recent history had to be taken into
    account. Germany had built up, and was building up, magnificent armaments,
    and with the aid of the Triple Alliance she had become the centre of a
    tremendous group. The natural consequence was that other powers had tended
    to approximate. I was not questioning for a moment Germany's policy, but
    this was the natural and inevitable consequence in the interests of
    security. We used to have much the same situation with France when she was
    very powerful on the sea that we had with Germany now. While the fact to
    which I referred created a difficulty, the difficulty was not insuperable;
    for two groups of powers might be on very friendly relations if there was
    only an increasing sense of mutual understanding and confidence. The
    present seemed to me to be a favorable moment for a new departure. The
    Morocco question was now out of the way, and we had no agreements with
    France or Russia except those that were in writing and published to the
    world."</p>

    <p>"The Chancellor interrupted me, and asked me whether this was really so.
    I replied that I could give him the assurance that it was so without
    reserve, and that in the situation, which now existed I saw no reason why
    it should not be possible for us to enter into a new and cordial
    friendship, carrying the two old ones into it, perhaps, to the profit of
    Russia and France as well as Germany herself. He replied that he had no
    reason to differ from this view."</p>

    <p>"In connection with my remarks as to the events of last Summer, he
    interposed that we had military preparations. I replied that no
    preparations had been made which were other than those required to bring
    the capacity of the British Army in point of mobilization to something
    approaching the standard which Germany had long ago reached, and which was
    with her a matter of routine. For this purpose we had studied our
    deficiencies and modes of operation<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_167"
    name="Page_167">[Pg 167]</a></span> * * * We could not be caught
    unprepared."</p>

    <h3><a id="NO_AGGRESSIVE_ALLIANCES" name="NO_AGGRESSIVE_ALLIANCES"></a>NO
    AGGRESSIVE ALLIANCES</h3>

    <p>The Chancellor seemed much pleased with Lord Haldane's explanation, and
    said: "There had been much talk of our fleet and our army, and the steps we
    had taken, but that he understood the position I had indicated." "I said,
    in reply, that it was a pleasure to me to hear this, and that I hoped I
    should carry him with me still further in my belief that if Germany had
    really, which I did not at all suppose, intended to crush France and
    destroy her capacity to defend herself, we in England would have had such a
    direct interest in the result that we could not have sat by and seen this
    done."</p>

    <p>"He said he did not dissent from this view, nor did he wish to hamper
    our freedom in such a case. But he wished to propose a formula; the balance
    of power was a phrase he did not like, though he admitted that the
    historical considerations I had referred to made it natural that some
    grouping should take place, and that England should lean toward the weaker
    side. He had, however, proposed, in his communication to us, a formula of
    neutrality which might go a long way to help."</p>

    <p>"I said I cordially agreed with the good intention of his formula, the
    working of which was that neither was to enter into any combinations
    against the other. If this meant combinations for attack or aggression, I
    was entirely of his mind. But I must put on spectacles in looking at his
    words, and, first of all, I would put on German spectacles. How would
    Germany find herself if, when bound by such a formula, we were so wicked as
    to attack her ally Austria or to try to grab Denmark, which was of deep
    strategical interest to her? Again, suppose Germany joined in an attack on
    Japan or Portugal or Belgium—he then interposed 'or Holland'—but I said I
    really hadn't all our treaties sufficiently in my head to be as sure about
    Holland as I was about the others. Or if, I added, Germany were to pounce
    upon France and proceed to dismember her, what would happen? He answered
    that these cases were not at all likely, but he admitted that they were
    fatal to his formula. I asked him whether he would be satisfied with mutual
    undertakings against aggressive or unprovoked attacks and against all
    combinations, military and naval agreements, and plans directed to the
    purpose of aggression and unprovoked attack. He said it was very difficult
    to define what was meant by aggression or unprovoked attack. I replied that
    you could not define the number of grains which it took to make a heap, but
    one knew a heap when one saw one." * * *</p>

    <h3><a id="QUESTION_OF_GERMAN_FLEET" name=
    "QUESTION_OF_GERMAN_FLEET"></a>QUESTION OF GERMAN FLEET</h3>

    <p>"We then passed on to the question of the German fleet, as to which he
    asked me to make any observations. I said I must. He and I had been talking
    with the most absolute candor and friendliness to each other, and I felt he
    would regard me as wanting in character were I not very frank with him
    about the new navy law. What was the use of entering into a solemn
    agreement for concord and against attack if Germany at the same moment was
    going to increase her battle fleet as a precaution against us, and we had
    consequently to increase our battle fleet as a precaution against her? This
    was vital from our point of view, because we were an island power dependent
    for our food supplies on the power of protecting our commerce, and for this
    we needed the two-power standard and a substantial preponderance in battle
    fleets. He said that it was absolutely essential to Germany to have a third
    squadron in full readiness for war. At present, owing to her system of
    recruiting, for three months in the year she had virtually, owing to the
    necessity for training recruits, no fleet ready at all. I said I did not
    contest this; she was quite entitled to have it if she thought it
    necessary, but the result would be that we should not be able to rely on
    the two battle squadrons and reserve squadrons which had sufficed hitherto,
    but that we should be compelled to have five, or even six, squadrons ready
    in home waters, perhaps bringing ships from the Mediterranean to strengthen
    them."</p>

    <p>"He asked me was that necessary if we had a friendly agreement? I said
    it would be a less convincing proof of friendliness if Germany prepared her
    third squadron, and we should have no option. Still, I said, this was not
    so serious as the proposal to add a third ship every second year to the
    German construction program. This would put us in great difficulties so far
    as securing the good opinion of the public in England about the value of an
    agreement. We should certainly have to proceed at once to lay down two
    keels to each one of the new German additions, and that would cost money
    and cause feeling. It was true that each country could bear the additional
    cost without difficulty. They were rich and so were we. If it was for the
    purpose of the navy our people would not complain, in my opinion, of the
    addition of another shilling to the income tax, but it would be a great
    pity. He asked was that really likely to be our program, the laying down of
    two additional keels for each German one. I said that I had no doubt that
    it would be the result, and the Government would be turned out if they
    failed to accomplish it; and therefore some modification seemed to be of
    the utmost importance, if the agreement was to be a real success."</p>

    <p>"After a pause he said he would consider this and 'die Sache überlegen.'
    The conversation up to this point had been largely in German, I taking to
    English whenever there was a delicate topic, and the Chancellor
    occasionally speaking English, but nearly always German. In order to avoid
    misunderstanding <span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_168" name="Page_168">[Pg
    168]</a></span>repeated sentences in the other language. I was impressed by
    his evident desire to meet us wherever he could, and I derived considerable
    hope from the manner and emphasis with which he said that he would
    reconsider the question of the ships. But I must add that he went on to say
    that the question of the new squadron was vital, and that some new ships
    would be necessary in it. Could I suggest any way out, for they must keep
    to the plan of a new law. I observed that it was not for me to venture to
    make any suggestion to his Excellency, but that a spreading out in size of
    the new program might make a difference. He said, 'Perhaps, eight or nine
    years'; I added, 'or twelve, if he could not do better.' He again said that
    he would take this matter into serious consideration and consult his
    experts. 'My Admirals,' he said, 'are very difficult.' 'That was an
    experience,' I observed, 'which we sometimes found in England also.'"</p>

    <h3><a id="THE_KAISER_AND_VON_TIRPITZ" name=
    "THE_KAISER_AND_VON_TIRPITZ"></a>THE KAISER AND VON TIRPITZ</h3>

    <p>On the following day, Feb. 9, Lord Haldane had an interview with the
    Emperor, the Chancellor, and Admiral Tirpitz on the navy, at which Tirpitz
    held out for the new German naval program, which was discussed at great
    length. Lord Haldane wrote:</p>

    <p>"I insisted that fundamental modification was essential. The tone was
    thoroughly friendly, but I felt that I had come to the most difficult part
    of my task of getting material fit to bring back for the consideration of
    my colleagues. The utmost I was able to get was this: The Emperor was so
    disturbed at the idea that the world would not believe in the reality of
    the agreement unless the shipbuilding program was modified that he asked me
    what I would suggest. I said that it was a too technical matter for me to
    discuss here, but that if he would not drop the new law—which I saw he felt
    he could not—he might at least drop out a ship. This idea was never
    abandoned, but Admiral Tirpitz combated it so hard that I said: 'Well, can
    we not spread the tempo?' After much talking we got to this, that, as I
    insisted that they must not inaugurate the agreement by building an
    additional ship at once, they should put off building the first ship till
    1913, and then should not lay down another till three years after, (1916,)
    and not lay down the third till 1919."</p>

    <p>"Admiral Tirpitz wanted us to give some understanding about our own
    shipbuilding. He thought the two-power standard a hard one for Germany,
    and, indeed, Germany could not make any admission about it. I said it was
    not a matter of admission. Germany must be free and we must be free, and we
    should probably lay down two keels to their one. In this case the
    initiative was not with us, but with them. An idea occurred to all of us on
    this observation that we should try to avoid defining a standard proportion
    in the agreement, and that, indeed, we should say nothing at all about
    shipbuilding in the if the political agreement was concluded the Emperor
    should at once announce to the German public that this entirely new fact
    modified his desire for the fleet law as originally conceived, and that it
    should be delayed and spread out to the extent we had discussed. For the
    rest, each of us would remain masters in our own houses as far as naval
    matters were concerned."</p>

    <p>"The Emperor thought the agreement would affect profoundly the tendency
    in shipbuilding, and he certainly should not desire to go beyond the three
    ships. The fact of the agreement was the key to everything. The Chancellor,
    he said, would propose to me this afternoon a formula which he had drafted.
    I said that I would see the Chancellor and discuss any further territorial
    questions with him, and would then return as speedily as I could and report
    the good disposition which I had found to my colleagues, and leave the
    difficulties of not being able to stop shipbuilding more completely, and,
    indeed, all other matters to their judgment. I could only assure the
    Emperor that I had been much struck with the friendly disposition in
    Berlin, and that he would find a not less friendly disposition in
    London."</p>

    <h3><a id="NO_AGREEMENT_REACHED" name="NO_AGREEMENT_REACHED"></a>NO
    AGREEMENT REACHED</h3>

    <p>Lord Haldane mentions that he was in communication with M. Jules Cambon,
    the French Ambassador in Berlin, and recounted his conversations to him.
    The Ambassador quite appreciated that the purpose of the mission was to
    create a detente, as distinguished from an entente. M. Jules Cambon
    reported his conversation with Lord Haldane to M. Poincaré.</p>

    <p>Lord Haldane had another conversation with the Chancellor in the hope of
    arriving at a formula with regard to the navy. The Chancellor said that the
    "forces he had to contend with were almost insuperable. Public opinion in
    Germany expected a new law and the third squadron, and he must have these.
    I said we could not contest Germany's right to do in these matters, and
    indeed in other matters, as she pleased. But why not postpone the
    shipbuilding for longer and adapt the law accordingly? * * *"</p>

    <p>"The Chancellor said he would try. He asked me to consult the experts in
    London and make a suggestion. I had said, he remarked, that everything was
    good only on balance, and Germany must for a greater end give up a minor
    advantage. The new squadron and the new fleet law she must have, but it was
    a question for the experts, on which he did not pronounce, whether a
    retardation of greater magnitude than Tirpitz proposed might not be
    possible. I promised to let him know privately the state of feeling here
    about the Tirpitz proposals on my return."</p>

    <p>The Ministers then endeavored to arrive at a formula, the whole purpose
    of which was to bring about conditions which would prevent<span class=
    "pagenum"><a id="Page_169" name="Page_169">[Pg 169]</a></span> war; to
    endeavor to get a definition of the duty of neutrality; and, in the event
    of war, to combine in order to localize the conflict.</p>

    <p>After Lord Haldane's return to London, negotiations in search of a
    formula were continued. Prince Lichnowsky preserved a friendly atmosphere,
    but the German Government never agreed to conditions which would have
    safeguarded the neutrality of Belgium or maintained her honorable
    obligations to our allies. The nearest they got at the eleventh hour was,
    as Lord Grey said, "far too narrow an engagement for us."</p>

    <h2><a id="British_Official_Statement_Issued_in_1915" name=
    "British_Official_Statement_Issued_in_1915"></a>British Official Statement
    Issued in 1915</h2>

    <p><i>The German press in 1915 made certain incorrect allegations regarding
    the Haldane Mission, whereupon on Aug. 31, 1915, the British Government
    issued the following official statement</i>:</p>

    <p><span class="smcap">The Foreign Office Issued the Following Statement
    Respecting the Anglo-German Negotiations of 1912</span>:</p>

    <p>An account of the 1912 Anglo-German negotiations was published in the
    semi-official Norddeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung last month. This account was
    misleading, and was no doubt intended to mislead, and made it appear that
    the British Government had at that time rejected what would be regarded in
    many quarters as a reasonable offer of friendship from Germany.</p>

    <p>In these circumstances it may be as well to publish a statement of the
    facts compiled from official records here. Early in 1912 the German
    Chancellor sketched to Lord Haldane the following formula as one which
    would meet the views of the Imperial Government:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>1. The high contracting parties assure each other mutually of their
        desire of peace and friendship.</p>

        <p>2. They will not either of them make or prepare to make any
        (unprovoked) attack upon the other, or join in any combination or
        design against the other for purposes of aggression, or become party to
        any plan or naval or military enterprise alone or in combination with
        any other power directed to such an end, and declare not to be bound by
        any such engagement.</p>

        <p>3. If either of the high contracting parties become entangled in a
        war with one or more powers in which it cannot be said to be the
        aggressor, the other party will at least observe toward the power so
        entangled a benevolent neutrality, and will use its utmost endeavor for
        the localization of the conflict. If either of the high contracting
        parties is forced to go to war by obvious provocation from a third
        party, they bind themselves to enter into an exchange of views
        concerning their attitude in such a conflict.</p>

        <p>4. The duty of neutrality which arises out of the preceding article
        has no application in so far as it may not be reconcilable with
        existing agreements which the high contracting parties have already
        made.</p>

        <p>5. The making of new agreements which render it impossible for
        either of the parties to observe neutrality toward the other beyond
        what is provided by the preceding limitation is excluded in conformity
        with the provisions in Article 2.</p>

        <p>6. The high contracting parties declare that they will do all in
        their power to prevent differences and misunderstandings arising
        between either of them and other powers.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <h3><a id="GERMAN_PLAN_ONE-SIDED" name="GERMAN_PLAN_ONE-SIDED"></a>GERMAN
    PLAN ONE-SIDED</h3>

    <p>These conditions, although in appearance fair as between the parties,
    would have been grossly unfair and one-sided in their operation. Owing to
    the general position of the European powers and the treaty engagements by
    which they were bound, the result of Articles 4 and 5 would have been that,
    while Germany in the case of a European conflict would have remained free
    to support her friends, this country would have been forbidden to raise a
    finger in defense of hers.</p>

    <p>Germany could arrange without difficulty that the formal inception of
    hostilities should rest with Austria. If Austria and Russia were at war,
    Germany would support Austria, as is evident from what occurred at the end
    of July, 1914; while as soon as Russia was attacked by two powers France
    was bound to come to her assistance. In other words, the pledge of
    neutrality offered by Germany would have been absolutely valueless, because
    she could always plead the necessity of fulfilling her existing obligations
    under the Triple Alliance as an excuse for departing from neutrality. On
    the other hand, no such departure, however serious the provocation, would
    have been possible for this country, which was bound by no alliances with
    the exception of those with Japan and Portugal, while the making of fresh
    alliances was prohibited by Article 5. In a word, as appeared still more
    evident later, there was to be a guarantee of absolute neutrality on one
    side but not on the other.</p>

    <p>It was impossible for us to enter into a contract so obviously
    inequitable, and the formula was accordingly rejected by Sir Edward
    Grey.</p>

    <p>Count Metternich upon this pressed for counter proposals, which he
    stated would be without prejudice and not binding unless we were satisfied
    that our wishes were met on the naval question. On this understanding Sir
    Edward Grey on the 14th of March, 1912, gave Count Metternich the following
    draft<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_170" name="Page_170">[Pg
    170]</a></span> formula, which had been approved by the Cabinet:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>England will make no unprovoked attack upon Germany, and pursue no
        aggressive policy toward her.</p>

        <p>Aggression upon Germany is not the subject, and forms no part of any
        treaty, understanding, or combination to which England is now a party,
        nor will she become a party to anything that has such an object.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Count Metternich thought this formula inadequate, and suggested two
    alternative additional clauses:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>England will therefore observe at least a benevolent neutrality
        should war be forced upon Germany; or</p>

        <p>England will therefore, as a matter of course, remain neutral if a
        war is forced upon Germany.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>This, he added, would not be binding unless our wishes were met with
    regard to the naval program.</p>

    <h3><a id="SIR_EDWARD_GREYS_VIEW" name="SIR_EDWARD_GREYS_VIEW"></a>SIR
    EDWARD GREY'S VIEW</h3>

    <p>Sir Edward Grey considered that the British proposals were sufficient.
    He explained that, if Germany desired to crush France, England might not be
    able to sit still, though, if France were aggressive or attacked Germany,
    no support would be given by his Majesty's Government or approved by
    England. It is obvious that the real object of the German proposal was to
    obtain the neutrality of England in all eventualities, since, should a war
    break out, Germany would certainly contend that it had been forced upon
    her, and would claim that England should remain neutral. An admirable
    example of this is the present war, in which, in spite of the facts,
    Germany contends that war has been forced upon her. Even the third member
    of the Triple Alliance, who had sources of information not open to us, did
    not share this view, but regarded it as an aggressive war.</p>

    <p>Sir Edward Grey eventually proposed the following formula:</p>

    <blockquote>
        <p>The two powers being mutually desirous of securing peace and
        friendship between them, England declares that she will neither make
        nor join in any unprovoked attack upon Germany. Aggression upon Germany
        is not the subject, and forms no part of, any treaty, understanding, or
        combination to which England is now a party, nor will she become a
        party to anything that has such an object.</p>
    </blockquote>

    <p>Sir Edward Grey when he handed this formula to Count Metternich said
    that the use of the word "neutrality" would convey the impression that more
    was meant than was warranted by the text; he suggested that the substance
    of what was required would be obtained and more accurately expressed by the
    words "will neither make nor join in any unprovoked attack."</p>

    <p>Count Metternich thereupon received instructions to make it quite clear
    that the Chancellor could recommend the Emperor to give up the essential
    parts of the Novelle (the bill then pending for the increase of the German
    Navy) only if we could conclude an agreement guaranteeing neutrality of a
    far-reaching character and leaving no doubt as to any interpretation. He
    admitted that the Chancellor's wish amounted to a guarantee of absolute
    neutrality, failing which the Novelle must proceed.</p>

    <p>Count Metternich stated that there was no chance of the withdrawal of
    the Novelle, but said that it might be modified; it would be disappointing
    to the Chancellor if we did not go beyond the formula we had suggested.</p>

    <p>Sir Edward Grey said that he could understand that there would be
    disappointment if his Majesty's Government were to state that the carrying
    out of the Novelle would put an end to the negotiations and form an
    insurmountable obstacle to better relations. His Majesty's Government did
    not say this, and it hoped that the formula which it had suggested might be
    considered in connection with the discussion of territorial arrangements,
    even if it did not prove effective in preventing the increase of naval
    expenditure.</p>

    <p>Sir Edward Grey added that if some arrangement could be made between the
    two Governments it would have a favorable though indirect effect upon naval
    expenditure as time went on; it would have, moreover, a favorable and
    direct effect upon public opinion in both countries.</p>

    <p>A few days afterward Count Metternich communicated to Sir Edward Grey
    the substance of a letter from the Chancellor, in which the latter said
    that, as the formula suggested by his Majesty's Government was from the
    German point of view insufficient, and as his Majesty's Government could
    not agree to the larger formula for which he had asked, the Novelle must
    proceed on the lines on which it had been presented to the Federal Council.
    The negotiations then came to an end, and with them the hope of a mutual
    reduction in the expenditure on armaments of the two countries.</p>
